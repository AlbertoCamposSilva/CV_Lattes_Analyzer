It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments.

@article{Kahneman1979,
   abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. CR - Copyright &#169; 1979 The Econometric Society},

To determine if the market induces a real deterrence effect, we extend the event windows up to one year. On average, the market reacts negatively and enduringly to the announcement of an accident. However, this average effect is largely driven by the airline industry and by government interventions. The estimated average compounded abnormal return following environmental accidents does not differ from zero after one year. This does not exclude, in severe events affecting large firms, huge losses in equity value, but the significant negative cumulative abnormal returns estimated immediately after an environmental accident in previous studies do not persist. Our results suggest that in a market driven by institutional investors, the deterrence effect is likely to be weak.},

One of the goals of the conservation easement program we study is to protect contiguous habitat. We identify endogenous spatial interactions among conservation easements and government protected land, independent of spatially correlated landscape features and local economic shocks that influence easement enrollment. We present evidence that easements increase the likelihood of subsequent easements on neighboring land. Government-protected land appears to have little effect on the location of conservation easements. These results imply that conservation agencies have leveraged past conservation investment to enroll more contiguous habitat in permanent easements through a combination of targeting and positive social interactions among neighboring landowners.},

Using general utility structures and exploring both linear and non-linear taxes, it is demonstrated that the optimal second-best tax on an externality-generating good should not be corrected for the marginal cost of public funds, since it equals one in the optimal tax system. In the optimum, distortions of income taxes are equal to marginal redistributional gains. If the government does not have access to a non-distortionary marginal source of finance, the marginal cost of public funds can be either larger or smaller than one depending on subjective preferences for income redistribution. The optimal second-best corrective tax is then either higher or lower than the Pigouvian level. The findings in this paper generalize and amend prior results based on representative-agent models, shedding new light on the weak double-dividend hypothesis, and on the welfare gains of recycling revenue from environmental taxes.},

In this framework, the formation of environmental preferences is the result of a cultural transmission process depending on the extent of private contributions. In the short run, we show that three equilibria may arise: a first one where all green agents contribute to the environment, a second one where nobody contributes to the environment and a third interior one. We show that the capital-accumulation process and the change in preferences that occur in this economy lead the interior equilibrium to be selected, in which some, but not all, green agents contribute to the environment. The model thus provides an economic rationale for the gap between the number of people who care about the environment and the number who adopt pro-environmental behaviours. We also show that the fraction of contributors rises with capital, so that we explain the negative relationship between this gap and country income. Last, we show that this gap is particularly detrimental for welfare, and analyse the impact of a number of public policies.},

With only idiosyncratic harvest uncertainty, we show that frictionless post-harvest quota trade can achieve full efficiency and eliminate quota-overage discards completely. In the absence of such trade, we deduce an ad valorem tax/subsidy that eliminates discards while delivering a desired aggregate harvest target. Alternatively, we show that a hybrid policy, i.e., a combined quota and landings fee, can implement a manager׳s aggregate target harvest level efficiently and without discards. When harvest shocks, in addition, have a fishery-wide common component, post-harvest quota trading per se cannot eliminate discards; policy intervention in the form of either landing taxes or a hybrid scheme is needed. Given the prevalence of trading restrictions in many quota-managed fisheries worldwide, our paper offers important policy advice.},

The level of reusability of waste products – or green design – is a crucial choice variable in the North. This is because, in the presence of imperfect international monitoring, non-reusable waste can be illegally mixed with reusable waste. I explore the driving forces for illegal waste movement, with a particular focus on local waste regulations such as the EU׳s Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Under mild conditions, it is shown that increasingly stringent regulations in the North can induce Northern firms to reduce product reusability. Consequently, the flow of non-reusable waste to the South increases, magnifying the pollution haven effect.},

Using longitudinal household survey data from western Kenya, we estimate the effects of health status on investments in soil quality, as indicated by households' agricultural land fallowing decisions. We first show that this effect is theoretically ambiguous: while health improvements lower discount rates and thus increase incentives to conserve natural resources, they also increase labor productivity and make it more likely that households can engage in labor-intensive resource extraction activities. We find that household size and composition are predictors of whether the effect of health improvements on discount rates dominates the productivity effect, or vice-versa. Since households with more and younger members are better able to reallocate labor to cope with productivity shocks, the discount rate effect dominates for these households and health improvements lead to greater levels of conservation. In smaller families with less substitutable labor, the productivity effect dominates and health improvements lead to greater environmental degradation.},

While calls for AM in natural resource management are common, many analyses have identified modest gains from this approach. I analytically and numerically examine the distribution of outcomes from AM under risk neutrality and risk aversion. The inspection decision is framed as a multi-armed bandit problem and solved using the Lagrangian decomposition method. Results show that even when expected gains are modest, asymmetry in the distribution of outcomes has important implications. Notably, AM can serve to buffer against large losses, even if the most likely outcome is a small loss.},

By examining the extent of compliance, our study’s results reflect both improvement toward and beyond compliance. By assessing compliance with multiple pollutants separately, our study examines whether audits influence the control of different pollutants uniformly. Lastly, we employ a dynamic panel estimator, which allows us to explore whether facilities adjust their discharges dynamically, while controlling for any inertia in facilities’ pollution control systems.

In the absence of a global carbon tax and of border carbon adjustments, output-based allocation is a third-best solution and is actually implemented (Australia, California, New Zealand). The EU has followed a different route; free allowances are allocated to existing or new capacities in proportion to a benchmark, independent of actual production. This paper compares these two schemes in a formal setting and shows that the optimal one is in fact a combination of both schemes, or output-based allocation alone if uncertainty is limited. A key assumption of our analysis is that the short-term import pressure depends both on the existing capacities and the level of demand, which is typical in capital intensive and internationally traded sectors. A calibration of the model is used to discuss the EU scheme for the cement sector in the third phase of the EU-ETS (2013–2020). This allows for a quantification of various policies in terms of welfare, investment, production, company profits, public revenues and leakage.},

We find a relative fall in sectoral exports in targeted cities after the implementation of the policy, which is sharper the more polluting the industry. Further, we find that the observed effect is mainly driven by privately owned firms, whereas exports of state-owned firms seem to be unaffected by the new policy.

Based on a fairly general model, a condition for a precautionary policy is discussed. By applying the framework to a common-property resource problem with a linear production technology, we illustrate how the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of equilibrium is altered due to the possibility of regime shifts. In particular, when the risk is endogenously affected by the players׳ behavior, potential regime shifts can facilitate the precautionary management of resources as long as the resource stock is in good shape. As the stock of resource becomes scarce, however, the precautionary effect vanishes and more aggressive resource exploitation emerges. The impacts of irreversibility on the equilibrium behavior are highlighted. It is also shown that there can exist a resource-depletion trap in which a regime shift, once it happens, triggers a continuous decline of resource stock no matter which regime materializes in the subsequent periods.},

   abstract = {We present results from laboratory emissions markets designed to investigate the effects of price controls and permit banking on limiting permit price risk. While both instruments reduce between-period price volatility and within-period price dispersion, combining price controls and permit banking yields important benefits. Banking alone produces high permit prices in earlier periods that fall over time, but the combined policy produces lower initial prices and lower volatility. However, banking, price controls, and the combination all produce higher between-period emissions volatility. Hence, for emissions markets that seek to control flow pollutants with strictly convex damages, efforts to limit permit price risk can result in higher expected damage.},

This mechanism relies crucially on the exhaustibility of fossil fuels. We analyze the effect of anticipated climate policies on emissions in a simple model with two fossil fuels: one scarce and dirty (e.g. oil), the other abundant and dirtier (e.g. coal). We derive conditions for a ‘green orthodox’: anticipated climate policies may reduce current emissions. The model can also be used to analyze spatial carbon leakage. Calibrations suggest that intertemporal carbon leakage (from 0% to 8%) is a relatively minor concern.},

We use a new IAM to estimate the VOI for each parameter over a range of assumed levels of study precision based on prior probability distributions calibrated using results from previous studies. We measure the VOI as the maximum fixed fraction of consumption that a social planner would be willing to pay to conduct a new study before setting a carbon tax.

Individual preferences differ from collective preferences. In households where there are two adults, we examine the preferences of each separately and then as a couple in collective decisions. We show the level of influence each has in developing the collective decision process. We use discrete choice experiments to model preference heterogeneity across three experiments on women, men and on both. We propose a random utility model which decomposes the error structure in the utility of alternatives so as to identify the individual influence in collective decisions. This approach to choice data analysis is new to environmental economics.},

Confirming Horowitz and McConnell׳s (2002) pioneering meta-analysis, we find the disparity is smaller for ordinary private goods than for public and non-market goods, that it is not solely an artifact of using hypothetical transactions or other weak experimental or survey methods, and that it is smaller for studies using student subjects. In addition, we find that the disparity is smaller when subjects have experience valuing the good in real markets or through repeated experimental trials. In contrast to Horowitz and McConnell, we find the disparity is significantly smaller in studies using incentive-compatible elicitation mechanisms. The disparity is smaller in more recent studies, an effect that is attributable only in part to changes in study characteristics.},

The conceptual framework shows that these policies differ in the incentives they create for the consumption and mix of different types of biofuels and in their effects on food and fuel prices and GHG emissions. We also simulate the welfare and GHG effects of these three policies which are normalized to achieve the same level of US GHG emissions. By promoting greater production of food-crop based biofuels, the RFS is found to lead to a larger reduction in fossil fuel use but also a larger increase in food prices and a smaller reduction in global GHG emissions compared to the LCFS and carbon tax. All three policies increase US social welfare compared to a no-biofuel baseline scenario due to improved terms-of-trade, even when environmental benefits are excluded; global social welfare increases with a carbon tax but decreases with the RFS and LCFS due to the efficiency costs imposed by these policies, even after including the benefits of mitigating GHG emissions.},

We use variation in the timing of MTBE bans across states to identify their effects on gasoline prices. We find that state bans increased reformulated gasoline prices by 3–6 cents in non-Midwestern states for which the bans were binding, with larger impacts during times of high ethanol prices relative to MTBE and crude oil. We find qualitatively similar, yet smaller effects for conventional gasoline. We argue on the basis of a simple conceptual model and supporting empirical evidence that these bans functioned as implicit ethanol blending mandates in areas that were previously using MTBE to comply with strict environmental constraints. Overall, our results are consistent with the theoretical prediction that mandating a minimum market share for a more costly alternative fuel—either directly, or implicitly through a ban on the preferred conventional fuel—will inevitably increase fuel prices in a competitive market.},

Border carbon adjustments and output-based allocation of emissions allowances can increase effectiveness of unilateral action but introduce distortions of their own. We assess antileakage measures as a function of abatement coalition size. We first develop a partial equilibrium analytical framework to see how these instruments affect emissions within and outside the coalition. We then employ a computable general equilibrium model of international trade and energy use to assess the strategies as the coalition grows. We find that full border adjustments rank first in global cost-effectiveness, followed by import tariffs and output-based rebates. The differences across measures and their overall appeal decline as the abatement coalition grows. In terms of cost, the coalition countries prefer border carbon adjustments; countries outside the coalition prefer output-based rebates.},

Provision has negative downstream externalities: contributions hurt agents outside the in-group (“Outsiders”), rendering them anti-social. Many models of social preferences predict that such externalities should reduce provision, although conditional cooperation or a preference for in-group members may counteract this. We test this model with a lab experiment using Outsiders with whom the in-group members have more and less contact. With homogeneous in-group benefits, the presence of negative downstream externalities reduces contributions by half when they have closer contact with Outsiders but not at all when they have had no contact. We introduce a rotating high-return position that allows subjects to trade favors. In this setting, contributions of non-privileged members diminish slightly when faced with the negative externality given closer contact with Outsiders, and not at all with less contact. Reciprocal giving occurs whether or not Outsiders are present.},

Since biofuel production competes for land with agricultural production, a carbon tax could increase land rents and raise food prices. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of a carbon tax on fuel consisting of gasoline and biofuel in the presence of a labor tax, with and without a biofuel subsidy. The market impacts of a carbon tax are also compared with that of a subsidy. Findings show that if a carbon tax increases biofuel demand, the tax interaction effect due to higher fuel prices is exacerbated by higher land rent and food prices and greater erosion of the carbon tax base. Thus, the second best optimal carbon tax for fuel is lower with biofuel in the fuel mix, especially if biofuel is subsidized.},

The model is parameterized with US data and includes key externalities in the energy/transportation sectors and possible underinvestment in energy efficiency due to “misperceptions” over energy savings. Even with large misperceptions, the extra welfare gains from complementing efficient pricing policies with energy efficiency standards are zero for reducing gasoline and 5 percent for reducing electricity. And when viewed as substitutes, these standards forgo 60 percent or more of the potential welfare gains from corresponding pricing policies. A combination of energy efficiency and emissions standards is more than three times as costly as carbon pricing when there is no misperception over energy savings, and even with large misperceptions, combining carbon pricing with gasoline/electricity taxes is better than combining it with energy efficiency standards.},

To that end, we extend the Great Fish War model of Levhari and Mirman (1980) to a learning environment in which several agents interact strategically and learn about the distribution of the stochastic evolution of the resource. We find that the effect of anticipation of learning with heterogeneous beliefs is twofold. First, the anticipation of learning makes future payoffs more uncertain, which induces the agents to decrease present exploitation due to the precautionary motive. Second, under heterogeneity of beliefs, there is a differential informational externality that induces the agents to increase or decrease present exploitation. We also perform a comparative analysis on the Cournot–Nash equilibrium with learning by studying the effect of optimism and riskiness on resource exploitation.},

The motivating example is that of an international climate agreement given private information about the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for emissions abatement. Due to multilateral externalities the principal uses her own emissions besides subsidies to incentivize the agent and to assure his participation. Optimal contracts equalize marginal abatement costs and, thus, can be implemented by a system of competitive permit trading. Moreover, optimal contracts can include a boundary part (i.e., the endogenous, type dependent participation constraint is binding), which is not a copy of the outside option of no contract. Compared to this outside option, a contract can increase emissions of the principal for types with a low WTP, and reduce her payoff for high types. Subsidies can be constant or even decreasing in emission reductions, and turn negative so that the agent reduces emissions and pays the principal.},

In the model individuals derive utility both from their own direct enjoyment of the public good and from the enjoyment of those in their network. We find that network structure almost always matters, both for utility and for valuation. The network increases aggregate valuation when it assigns higher importance, that is, stronger connections, to individuals with higher private values for the public good. The model provides a theoretical foundation for the idea of opinion leaders who have disproportionate influence over their communities. Specifically, opinion leaders are individuals assigned high importance by the network, and projects favored by opinion leaders tend to be favored by the network as a whole. The model can also guide future empirical studies by enabling a more structural approach to non-market valuation in a socially connected group.},

According to some theorists (e.g. Arrow et al., 2012), under certain conditions a country with a positive level of GS should experience non-declining future utility, given the assumption of unlimited substitutability among all forms of capital (sometimes called “weak” sustainability). This paper reports the first very long-run tests of GS (also called comprehensive investment or adjusted net savings) as a forward-looking indicator of future well-being. We assemble data for British capital back to 1765, and construct several net investment measures which are used as indicators of two alternative measures of future well-being: consumption per capita and real wages. An allowance for a “value of time” due to exogenous technological progress is included in some GS measures, and we demonstrate the importance of this measure and the choice of discount rate over the very long-run. On the whole, our results do not reject the postulated relationship between GS and future well-being, and show GS can be a forward looking indicator of future well-being for periods of up to 100 years.},

Although still focussed on domestic development goals, BASIC countries have made important steps toward a greater engagement in the global climate agenda. For India, the shift was marked by a voluntary, but conditional, target of reducing emission intensity, away from the past nor- mative position based on ‘‘equal per capita,’’ emissions entitlements. The new track aims at finding cost-effective mitigation strategies that align national development goals and cli- mate actions. This paper examines the mitigation potential of a domestic sustainable development policy using a suite of integrated assessment models. The long-term goal is to keep temperature increase below 2?C. This article shows that it is possible to match domestic development goals and climate mitigation. Win–win options exist and side ben- efits—in terms of energy security and local pollution—are important. However, develop- ment policies are not sufficient to achieve the desired emissions reductions.We find that it is necessary to introduce a constraint on the carbon budget. The price of carbon that emerges is however much lower than in a conventional mitigation scenario.

Rational agents are supposed to consider the cost and benefits of cooperation, which then determine their negotiation positions. Behavioral economics provides experimental evidence that decision-making in negotiation-like situations is influenced by systematic cognitive biases and social interaction. In this paper, we examine the impact of bounded rationality and social preferences on bargaining in international climate negotiations and illustrate how particular deviations from full rationality affect the incentives to cooperate. Of special interest are fairness preferences for burden-sharing rules and behavioral responses to different framings of climate change and policy, as well as implications of these for communication about climate change. The analysis will further address different levels of representation, including individual citizens, politicians, experts, and (professional) negotiators.

As several countries wish to increase their activity, the harvest should be managed according to integrated and participatory governance regimes to ensure production within a long-term perspective. Development of regulations and directives enabling the sustainable exploitation of natural resources must therefore be brought to the national and international political agenda in order to ensure environmental, social, and economic values in the coastal areas around the world. In Europe, Portugal requires an appraisal of seaweed management plans while Norway and Canada have developed and implemented coastal management plans including well-established and sustainable exploitation of their natural seaweed resources. Whereas, in Latin America, different scenarios of seaweed exploitation can be observed; each country is however in need of long-term and ecosystem-based management plans to ensure that exploitation is sustainable. These plans are required particularly in Peru and Brazil, while Chile has succeeded in establishing a sustainable seaweed-harvesting plan for most of the economically important seaweeds. Furthermore, in both Europe and Latin America, seaweed aquaculture is at its infancy and development will have to overcome numerous challenges at different levels (i.e., technology, biology, policy). Thus, there is a need for regulations and establishment of "best practices" for seaweed harvesting, management, and cultivation. Trained human resources will also be required to provide information and education to the communities involved, to enable seaweed utilization to become a profitable business and provide better income opportunities to coastal communities. © 2014 The Author(s).},

In June 2012, at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, States agreed to take a decision on the development of an international instrument under UNCLOS before the end of the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), which runs from September 2014 to August 2015.

It first reviews the history of UN discussions, and then elaborates on options to address key elements identified as priorities for States in 2011: marine genetic resources, including the sharing of benefits, area-based management tools, including marine protected areas, environmental impact assessments, capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology. It addresses cross-cutting issues such as the governing principles, institutional structure as well as on other critical points such as High Seas fishing and flag State responsibilities. The article concludes with suggestions on possible next steps in order to succeed in the negotiations for an agreement. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The management of natural forests in Brazil is concentrated in the states of the Legal Amazon with almost all legal timber extraction occurring on private land. While the government has historically promoted the development of forest plantations through economic incentives, state involvement with natural forests has focused on regulation. Over 1??million km
                        2 in the Legal Amazon have been identified as suitable for the production of forest goods and services and other resource-based activities (Ver??ssimo et al., 2000, p. 6). Only recently, however, has the state taken action to harness the potential this vast public resource holds for promoting sustainable development. In March 2006, the Public Forest Management Law was passed by the government of President Luiz In??cio Lula da Silva. A key feature of this law is a framework for creating forest concessions on public lands. With the goal of establishing up to 13??million ha of forest concessions by the end of the decade, such an initiative for the development of the forest sector is unprecedented in Brazilian history, marking the state's recognition of the Amazon's vocation as one of forest-based development. A static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is developed to evaluate the short-run socio-economic and environmental implications of implementing forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon. Results indicate that household income and private consumption increase with the implementation of forest concessions. With the expansion of natural forest management in the north, forest plantations contract significantly in all regions and to a lesser degree, natural forest management in the north east and center west. As forest plantations demand less agricultural land for production, the price of agricultural land decreases and the excess supply is taken up by the agricultural sector which pays less for the land and consequently produces more of a less expensive product. The implementation of forest concessions results in a 3.8% increase in legal deforestation with the largest increase in the north, followed by the north east and center west. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the current proportion of biodiesel in the diesel mixture (5%) increases consumers' price by 1.7% and decreases the consumption by 1.5% compared to the scenario without biodiesel.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether royalties distributed under the new law have contributed for the development of benefited municipalities. For that the difference-in-differences estimator (diff-in-diff) is used, which compares the evolution of the economic product into the municipality affected by the new law with the unaffected ones, by exploring the new legislation as an exogenous change. The data refer to the municipal gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate before and after the event. Results are surprising, showing that royalty receivers grew less than municipalities that did not receive such resources. The difference is small but statistically significant.

   abstract = {The exploitation of macroalgae of the genus Gracilaria for agar extraction has increased significantly in recent decades. In Brazil, Gracilaria birdiae is one of the species exploited commercially by fishing communities and the excess harvesting of seaweeds of this genus has had negative consequences on the sustainability of this natural resource. Thus, the aim of this study was to gather basic information about the growth rates of G. birdiae required for the development of mariculture in this region. Throughout the study period salinity and temperature remained relatively constant, with a mean of 35 PSU and 28 ??C, respectively. Biomass values did not vary significantly between the periods studied (p > 0.05). The mean biomass recorded during the entire experimental period was approximately 1900 g Fw m-1. The highest relative growth rate (RGR) was recorded in the dry season (7.45% d-1) but there was no significant difference between the periods (p > 0.05). Mean RGR for the two periods were 4.4% d-1 and 4.3% d-1 for the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Positive correlations were found between biomass (r = 0.39; p < 0.001) and RGR (r = 0.41; p < 0.001) and NH4+. Agar yield ranged from 22% to 15%. The highest mean was obtained in the rainy season (~20%). Gel strength varied between 850 and 650 g cm2. The mean obtained for the two periods was approximately 750 g cm2. These results demonstrate the great potential of G. birdiae for mariculture and its possible economic use by coastal communities. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are globally threatened by overexploitation and habitat destruction; they are also regarded as susceptible to heavy exploitation due to some of their life-history traits. From an economic perspective, they are fishes with high monetary value and marketability. Seahorses are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), to ensure that the international trade is not detrimental to the survival of wild populations; the effectiveness evaluation of these international controls needs comparable monitoring data, including evaluation of spatial and temporal trends. This study assesses the seahorse trade in Brazil, aiming to detect trends in catch levels, volumes and prices. Our main findings were: the dried trade was unregulated, without formal records, and primarily domestic, although records of unreported exports existed; it was primarily sustained by incidental captures in trawl nets. The live seahorse trade was mainly destined for exports, and regulated through national quotas. Between 2002 and 2009, mean prices for dried seahorses ranged from US$1.06 ± 0.46 (level 1 traders) to US$2.78 ± 0.68 (end-sellers) each, while mean prices for each live seahorse traded on the domestic market (1997–2009) ranged from US$1.13 ± 0.02 (level 1 traders) to US$10.08 ± 1.71 (retailers). Mean declared export price (2006–2008) was 15.57 ± 10.87. Enhanced implementation of the CITES listing in Brazil will require further research, and additional measures to address both direct and indirect fishing pressure on seahorse populations.},

   abstract = {In response to the increasing loss of native vegetation and biodiversity, a growing number of countries have adopted " offsetting" policies that seek to balance local habitat destruction by restoring, enhancing and/or protecting similar but separate habitat. Although these policies often have a stated aim of producing a " net gain" or " no net loss" in environmental benefits, it is challenging to determine the potential impacts of a policy and if, or when, it will achieve its objectives. In this paper we address these questions with a general approach that uses predictive modelling under uncertainty to quantify the ecological impacts of different offset policies. This is demonstrated with a case study to the west of Melbourne, Australia where a proposed expansion of Melbourne's urban growth boundary would result in a loss of endangered native grassland, requiring offsets to be implemented as compensation. Three different offset policies were modelled: i) no restrictions on offset location, ii) offset locations spatially restricted to a strategically defined area and iii) offset locations spatially and temporally restricted, requiring all offsets to be implemented before commencing development. The ecological impact of the policies was determined with a system model that predicts future changes in the extent and condition of native grassland. The case study demonstrates how relative and absolute policy performance can be quantified in relation to best and worst-case scenarios. The study also shows that the ecological benefits of being temporally and spatially strategic in choosing offsets locations are substantially greater than being spatially strategic alone. We also show that even with considerable uncertainties in the system model predicting future grassland condition, the performance of the three offset policies can still be differentiated. Finally, we show the extent to which a policy achieves a " net gain" is dependent on the baseline against which policy performance is measured. The quantitative framework presented here can also be used to evaluate other offset policies or extended to deal with different types of environmental policies. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

There is a heavy dependence on the public sector, but macroeconomic policies aimed at reducing government spending have resulted in reduced budgets dedicated to public conservation measures. The financial con- straints for environmental protection have also increased because of a reduction in foreign aid. Positive signs for the immediate future, however, come from newinitiatives that create economic instruments to finance con- servation. The most important initiatives include conservation criteria for tax redistribution; environmental compensation;water charges; royalties for electricity, petroleum, and natural gas; tradable obligations for forest reserves; and voluntary measures on the part of the business sector. Resources created from these initiatives have different origins and are managed by different public agencies according to varying laws and policies, so their efficient implementation will require that the institutions involved in biodiversity conservation in Brazil establish a minimum set of common priorities and objectives.},

The accounting framework to achieving this objective is considered, focused on the role of asset registers. Particular attention is paid to renewable assets at risk of falling below critical thresholds. These assets are key components of the balance sheet. Capital maintenance expenditures are required to maintain the value of assets intact, since renewable natural assets should not be depreciated, but rather treated as assets in perpetuity. Within the aggregate, substitutions with other forms of capital are permitted, but only if there is compensation for any detriment to natural capital. Offsetting is one mechanism for achieving this compensation. The case for enhancing the aggregate is considered, and the paper shows how a broader national plan over a generation could contribute to the policy objective of leaving the next generation with a richer endowment of natural capital.

   abstract = {To achieve meaningful sustainable development, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should avoid the net losses in the environment resource base. But EIA practice does not always avoid the losses caused by the implementation of the projects under EIA regulation. Some environmental impacts are, simply, admitted, even without enforcing any form of compensation. When applied, compensation is sometimes just a monetary payment to offset the environmental loss.This paper looks for evidence on the role that compensation is given at present in EIA practice in Spain, and for some of its conceptual and regulatory roots. Specifically, it explores how compensation is addressed in 1302 records of decision (RODs) on those projects subject to the Spanish EIA regulation published during the years 2006 and 2007, to know how far Spain is from preserving the environmental resource base managed through this particular aspect of EIA practice.As a result, it is concluded that the practice of ecological compensation in EIA in Spain is much lower than it could be expected in a theoretical sustainability context committed to avoid net losses in the environment resource base, mainly due to an EIA practice focused on on-site mitigation that allows these net losses. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {The use of economic valuation methods to assess environmental impacts of projects and policies has grown considerably in recent years. However, environmental valuation appears to have developed independently of regulations and practice of environmental impact assessment (EIA), despite its potential benefits to the EIA process. Environmental valuation may be useful in judging significance of impacts, determining mitigation level, comparing alternatives and generally enabling a more objective analysis of tradeoffs. In China, laws and regulations require the use of environmental valuation in EIA, but current practice lags far behind. This paper assesses the problems and prospects of introducing environmental valuation into the EIA process in China. We conduct four case studies of environmental economic impact assessment (EEIA), three of which are based on environmental impact statements of construction projects (a power plant, a wastewater treatment plant and a road construction project) and one for a regional pollution problem (wastewater irrigation). The paper demonstrates the potential usefulness of environmental valuation but also discusses several challenges to the introduction and wider use of EEIA, many of which are likely to be of relevance far beyond the Chinese context. The paper closes with suggesting some initial core elements of an EEIA guideline. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Land use conversions rank among the most significant drivers of change in ecosystem services worldwide, affecting human wellbeing and threatening the survival of other species. Hence, predicting the effects of land use decisions on ecosystem services has emerged as a crucial need in spatial planning, and in the associated Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) practice. The paper presents a case-study research aimed at empirically exploring how the implementation of different land-use zoning policies affect the future provision of a set of ecosystem services (water purification, soil conservation, habitat for species, carbon sequestration and timber production). The study area is located in The Araucan??a, one of Chile's Administrative Regions. The first part of the methods consisted in the construction of land-use scenarios associated to different policies. Subsequently, the effects of the land-use scenarios on the provision of the selected ecosystem services were assessed in a spatially explicit way, by using modeling tools. Finally, a set of metrics was developed to compare scenarios, and trade-offs in the provision of different ecosystem services were made explicit through trade-off curves. The results indicate that, for this case study, spatial configuration of land uses is as an important factor as their size. This suggests that the analysis of land-use patterns deserves attention, and that this information should be included in scenario exercises aimed to support spatial planning. The paper concludes by discussing the potential contribution of the approach to support SEA of spatial plans. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {With increasing road encroachment, habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for European biodiversity. Areas with no roads or little traffic ("roadless and low-traffic areas") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.},

   abstract = {Internationally there is a growing demand for environmental impact assessment (EIA) to move away from its traditional focus towards delivering more sustainable outcomes. South Africa is an example of a country where the EIA system seems to have embraced the concept of sustainability. In this paper we test the existing objectives for EIA in South Africa against sustainability principles and then critique the effectiveness of EIA practice in delivering these objectives. The outcome of the research suggests that notwithstanding a strong and explicit sustainability mandate through policy and legislation, the effectiveness of EIA practice falls far short of what is mandated. This shows that further legislative reform is not required to improve effectiveness but rather a focus on changing the behaviour of individual professionals. We conclude by inviting further debate on what exactly practitioners can do to give effect to sustainability in EIA practice. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

On average, about 20% of the annual GDP per capita increase is due to the endowment of petroleum resources such as oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and condensate.

This, in turn, has led to a growing concern over issues of epistemology in risk communication, and, in particular, interest in how knowledge is constructed and employed by the key players in risk--scientists, policy makers, and the public. This article uses a critical theoretical approach to explore how evidence is recognized and validated, and how limits are placed on knowledge by scientists, policy makers, and the public. It brings together developments in the sociology of science, policy and policy development, public understandings of science, and risk communication and analysis to explicate the differing forms of rationality employed by each group. The work concludes that each group employs different, although equally legitimate, forms of rationality when evaluating evidence and generating knowledge around risky environment and health issues. Scientists, policy makers, and the public employ scientific, political, and social rationality, respectively. These differing forms of rationality reflect underlying epistemological distances from which can develop considerable misunderstandings and misinterpretations.},

The second section contains a review of the technical methods which are used in the preparation and publication of EIA studies. These are grouped according to the kind of task they perform in the EIA process: identification, data assembly, prediction, evaluation and communication.

The range of uncertainties includes internal and external factors of the complex system that is concerned in the strategy. Scenario analysis is increasingly being used to cope with uncertainty in SEA. Following a brief introduction of scenarios and scenario analysis, this paper examines the rationale for scenario analysis in SEA in the context of China. The state of the art associated with scenario analysis applied to SEA in China was reviewed through four SEA case analyses. Lessons learned from these cases indicated the word "scenario" appears to be abused and the scenario-based methods appear to be misused due to the lack of understanding of an uncertain future and scenario analysis. However, good experiences were also drawn on, regarding how to integrate scenario analysis into the SEA process in China, how to cope with driving forces including uncertainties, how to combine qualitative scenario storylines with quantitative impact predictions, and how to conduct assessments and propose recommendations based on scenarios. Additionally, the ways to improve the application of this tool in SEA were suggested. We concluded by calling for further methodological research on this issue and more practices. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Understandably, it is assumed that such disclosures lead to greater scrutiny and better policy decisions. This paper questions this assumption. Drawing on constructivist theories of knowledge and an analysis of the role of narratives in managing uncertainty, I argue that the disclosure of uncertainty can obscure as much as it reveals about the impacts of a development project. It is proposed that the opening up of institutional spaces that can facilitate the negotiation and deliberation of foundational assumptions and parameters that feed into predictive models could engender greater legitimacy and credibility for IA outcomes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Construction industry is the most significant fields on a global scale, with respect to its economic, technological, and environmental impact. Its rapid growth over the last decades has resulted in an enormous increase of the produced construction and demolition waste, thus provoking a considerable burden on the environment. The proposed methodological framework is aiming towards optimal location of units of alternative construction and demolition waste management and it is following the path of multicriteria analysis. For the problem under study, ELECTRE III technique is adopted. The decision process presented requires the adoption of a number of logical steps mainly, clarification of the decision criteria for selecting the optimal location (economical, environmental and social), the definition of their relative significance and data assembly. The approach allows a robust parameter analysis in order to evaluate and compare in detail all available alternatives. On top of that, sensitivity analysis is also available, since parameter values in real life applications originate from estimations which are sometimes more or less reliable. This paper presents an effort to interlace local acceptance, financial viability and level of environmental quality which represents a vital issue for the particular waste stream's management efficiency. The methodology is implemented and demonstrated for the case of the Region of Central Macedonia, Greece and can be employed either by private investors or public authorities in other areas internationally. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Achieving adequate management and protection of natural assets as ecosystems and their services, habitats, biodiversity requires that the socio-economic and human security needs of the coastal populations are met. One way to reach the goal is to enable them, representing about 50% of the global population and increasing, to fight poverty and cope with uncertainties and changing conditions of employment, environment and sustainability through proper governance of the coastal and ocean assets. This includes provision of education and knowledge as regards these assets and their proper uses. They include energy, water, food, transportation and trade, communication, coastal developments, tourism, recreation and ecosystem services, as well as the need to properly manage them.The present economic system cannot fully harmonize with the required governance, partly since the ecosystem resources and services are not internalised in the market-oriented system. This calls for a revised education and training system, more comprehensive than the present, taking into account the social, cultural and environmental requirements, and stressing the sustainable development paradigm. In order to achieve ocean governance and comprehensive human security an understanding of the system is needed. This is substantiated through the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development as well as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.The aim here is to discuss some of the issues in context of implementation of related ocean conventions and commitments, which include achieving ocean governance, and to elucidate opportunities given by oceans and coasts, also in generating employment and providing for basic human needs. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Uncertainty is characterised using a probabilistic approach and propagated using a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The methodological approach is illustrated on a case study which compares the sustainability of two options for electricity generation: coal versus biomass. Different models have been used to quantify their sustainability performance for a number of economic, environmental and social criteria. Three cases are considered with respect to uncertainty: (1) no uncertainty, (2) uncertainty in data/models and (3) uncertainty in models and decision-makers preferences.

   abstract = {The primary objective of the Northern River Basins Study (NRBS) was to advance the understanding of how anthropogenic developments have impacted the ecology of the Peace, Athabasca and Slave rivers, Canada. To investigate these multiple stressor impacts, the NRBS used a cumulative effects assessment (CEA) based upon a weight of evidence approach. This CEA determined the exposure and effects of multiple stressors on these systems and included experimental verification of causality and linkage of this understanding to field data. Fish studies confirmed that dioxins and furans occur in the food web at low levels across the basins; detection frequencies for all 2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin/furan congeners (2,3,7,8 TCDD/TCDF) were highest near bleached kraft pulp mills. PCDD/Fs, rather than PCBs or organochlorine pesticides, were the chemicals of concern for human exposure. In addition, the recent decline in concentrations of dioxins and furans in fish was commensurate with improvements in pulp mill treatment technologies. Throughout the basins, enrichment occurred below pulp mill and municipal discharges. Multiple stressor effects of pulp mill effluent were separated from one another by using experiments that demonstrated that the primary impact of the mill effluent was nutrient enrichment. River state was also greatly influenced by hydrologic impacts. In particularly, the Bennett Dam changed the ecology of the Peace-Slave river-delta systems more than 1500 km downstream, while climate variability was an important contributing factor for these delta impacts. Notable contributions of the NRBS model were the cooperation among governments, aboriginal peoples, non-government organizations, industry and other stakeholders, and the two-way communications flow among the scientific community and these groups. NRBS science was also deemed relevant because 16 questions forwarded by stakeholders focused the Study’s CEA on specific issues of importance within the basin. In summary, the NRBS model of CEA included four key components: (1) communication of stakeholder priorities to produce relevant science questions; (2) pursuit of the best available scientific understanding of ecosystem impacts by engaging interdisciplinary science teams; (3) assessment of future environmental condition through monitoring and follow-up investigation; and (4) communication of results to managers to produce appropriate regulatory change. This CEA model combines these elements with scientific rigor to generate meaningful information to stakeholders while also improving regional assessments of river basins.},

They have ascribed shortcomings in the way developing states use those techniques to insufficient training, environmental matters being poorly integrated into economic decision making, other institutional weaknesses and lack of capacity. These reductionist explanations ignore the influence that socio-political and economic factors may have on state environmental management. They afford only a limited understanding of environmental practice in the Fiji Islands, a South Pacific archipelago and republic. The attempts of Fijian chiefly elite to maintain their power base - achieved through political participation in the state and economic development activities as much as through maintaining the communal system - shape the state's environmental management practices. Those practices have far less rational and democratic bases than one would expect either from the underlying logic of the techniques used (such as environmental impact assessment, environmental planning and protected areas), or from the way those techniques are applied in western, industrialized countries},

Nowadays, national and supranational public works programmes define strict completion dates at the client's risk of losing funding if deadlines are not met. The choice of procurement method is therefore of utmost importance. In most cases, the client's award is based on financial offers only. As the construction time for project completion within funding programme targets is extremely important, it should also be considered as an award criterion. In this paper, the most common award methods are evaluated and a new one is proposed. The award criterion considered is the most economically advantageous tender as defined in the European Union Legislation and takes into account the construction cost and completion time. The evaluation of both financial and time offers is carried out by implementing utility theory. An illustrative example is provided. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The value of having financial partners as well as manufacturing partners is demonstrated, although it is also shown that financial partner contributions to the project should be limited. We also consider the situation where partners have pre-existing commitments to other projects, perhaps with competitors. The producers sales may be correlated with the partners profits on pre-existing commitments so the impact on contract structure is explored. It is shown that even if a partner had preexisting commitments whose profit is positively correlated with product sales then it is often beneficial to use such a partner. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {In contractual relationships involving payments for environmental services, conservation buyers know less than landowners know about the costs of contractual compliance. Landowners in such circumstances use their private information as a source of market power to extract informational rents from conservation agents. Reducing informational rents is an important task for buyers of environmental services who wish to maximize the services obtained from their limited budgets. Reducing informational rents also mitigates concerns about the "additionality" of PES contracts because low-cost landowners are least likely to provide different levels of services in the absence of a contract. Paying low-cost landowners less thus makes resources available for contracts with higher opportunity cost landowners, who are more likely to provide substantially different levels of services in the absence of a contract. To reduce informational rents to landowners, conservation agents can take three approaches: (1) acquire information on observable landowner attributes that are correlated with compliance costs; (2) offer landowners a menu of screening contracts; and (3) allocate contracts through procurement auctions. Each approach differs in terms of its institutional, informational and technical complexity, as well as in its ability to reduce informational rents without distorting the level of environmental services provided. No single approach dominates in all environments. Current theory and empirical work provides practitioners with insights into the relative merits of each approach. However, more theoretical work and experimentation in the laboratory and the field are necessary before definitive conclusions about the superiority of one or more of these approaches can be drawn. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These challenges require investments by the public sector, while the countries have seen in the last years their debts rising. A solution to promote bioenergy business, without rising public debt, could be the use of PPP (Public-Private Partnership). This paper presents a methodology to develop agro-energy business using PPP in two rural areas: the municipality of Evropos (in Greece) and the municipality of Montefalco (in Italy). At first biomass availability is studied, then the optimal technology is selected. Once technological issues have been analyzed PPP value for money has to be assessed. Conventional methods to evaluate economic viability of a project are not enough and a Public-Sector Comparator (PSC) has to be calculated. Typical risks of bioenergy projects are identified, estimating their probabilities and consequences. This will lead to associate a monetary value to each risk. Then the identified risks are allocated among private and public partners, establishing synergies. The allocation of risks will have consequences on the preparation of PPP contract and on partner selection procedure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We find that there is an important threshold value of short-run patience. When the consumer’s short-term patience is below this level, then, as the patience increases, the firm suffers. When the consumer’s short-run patience is above this threshold, then, as it increases, the firm benefits. Finally, we show that unlike monopoly, perfect competition with asymmetric information achieves the first-best outcome. (JEL D03, D82, D91)},

   abstract = {The natural resources managed by government agencies are commonly subject to injuries from accidental events. In order for agencies to evaluate alternative management plans, economic damage estimates are required of potential natural resource injuries under alternative scenarios. However, accurate damage estimates are often difficult to obtain because of a lack of data on the ex ante economic costs of natural resource injuries. In recent years, trustees have increasingly used habitat equivalency analysis (HEA) to scale compensation for natural resource injuries. Unlike traditional economic analysis, which bases damage estimates on losses to human use (and sometimes nonuse) values, HEA estimates the ecological service loss of the injury and then scales restorative ecological compensation to offset these losses. Thus, HEA aims to maintain a baseline level of ecological functioning rather than a baseline level of human welfare. This paper describes the first attempt to use the HEA approach as an ex ante policy evaluation tool. The specific policy application is offshore oil development managed by the U.S. Minerals Management Service. We describe the reasons HEA was deemed the appropriate methodology to evaluate the ecological damages of potential oil releases into the environment. We then discuss the procedures used to estimate potential natural resource injuries, derive suitable ecological compensation in a HEA framework, and convert restorative ecological compensation into economic damage estimates. The validity of the economic estimates is explored by comparison to existing data. We conclude that HEA offers a viable alternative to traditional economic analysis when potential injuries to ecological habitats are being evaluated. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This methodology compares resources lost as a result of an incident to benefits that can be gained from a habitat or wildlife restoration project. Compensation is evaluated in terms of resource services instead of market currency. Recently, this approach has been questioned regarding its ability to provide adequate compensation based on economic welfare principles. The following paper examines these critiques and develops a model to quantify the welfare implications of using REA when some of its implicit assumptions are violated. We focus on the situation where compensatory restoration projects provide services that are comparable to those lost as a result of an incident. We examine simulation scenarios where the public has heterogeneous preferences for resources and where resource values change over time. Using the Hicks-Kaldor criterion, we find that the traditional REA provides an acceptable approximation of aggregate compensation for a reasonably wide range of economic and biological parameter combinations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The findings suggest that - in some cases - providing both monetary and environmental compensation can be the cost-minimising option.

This principle is designed to enhance the input of nature conservation interests in decision-making on large-scale development projects and to counterbalance the ecological impacts of such developments when implemented. This article evaluates the application of the Dutch compensation principle in highway planning. Six current highway projects reveal consistent implementation of this principle, although provincial policies on compensation and a national method for identifying compensation measures are still under development. As the planning process has not yet been completed for all the projects, no general conclusions can be drawn on the impact of the compensation principle on highway decision-making. Nevertheless, several examples show that the principle stimulates project initiators to develop alternative routes or route sections in order to avoid or reduce ecological impacts and the need for coherent compensation measures. If the compensation principle is to be properly implemented in the context of highway planning, particular attention should be paid to the following aspects: (1) sequential assessment of overall project legitimacy and the necessity of intersecting protected areas and compensation measures. (2) the initiator's attempts to avoid and mitigate ecological impacts in developing alternative routes prior to compensation for impacts, and (3) the role of uncertain ecological impacts in identifying compensation measures, especially those concerning habitat isolation.},

   abstract = {Coastal and other area resources such as tidal wetlands, seagrasses, coral reefs, wetlands, and other ecosystems are often harmed by environmental damage that might be inflicted by human actions, or could occur from natural hazards such as hurricanes. Society may wish to restore resources to offset the harm, or receive compensation if this is not possible, but faces difficult choices among potential compensation projects. The optimal amount of restoration efforts can be determined by non-market valuation methods, service-to-service, or resource-to-resource approaches such as habitat equivalency analysis (HEA). HEA scales injured resources and lost services on a one-to-one trade-off basis. Here, we present the main differences between the HEA approach and other non-market valuation approaches. Particular focus is on the role of the social discount rate, which appears in the HEA equation and underlies calculations of the present value of future damages. We argue that while HEA involves elements of economic analysis, the assumption of a one-to-one trade-off between lost and restored services sometimes does not hold, and then other non-market economic valuation approaches may help in restoration scaling or in damage determination.},

Following the promulgation of the Act in June 1993, the Department of Environment (DOE) is issuing an average of 125 EIA licenses yearly. In general, the review exercise of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is terminated once the license has been granted. The aim of this project was to evaluate the EIA system in Mauritius and to identify its weaknesses and strengths. One of the main weaknesses, besides the lack of EIA audits, is the absence of EIA follow-up monitoring. It is necessary to distinguish between monitoring done for regulatory purposes (compliance monitoring) and environmental monitoring related to the EIA. With the growth of the tourism industry on the island, coastal development projects have the potential to cause significant environmental impacts . A sample of EIA reports pertaining to this sector was assessed for its quality and follow-up mechanisms.

   abstract = {This article looks into the scope and equity implications of applying payments for environmental services (PES) as a REDD implementation mechanism in the Brazilian Amazon. We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Since environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations were adopted in China 30. years ago, the implementation rate of EIA policies for development projects has been steadily increasing while national environmental quality keeps deteriorating. This contradiction prevents achievement of the goals that the regulations were originally created for, raising concerns regarding the EIA implementation process. One of the objectives of EIA is the evaluation of socio-economic costs introduced by various commercial activities. However, independent economic entities are inclined to break away from these cost related responsibilities, making it necessary for government agencies and EIA organizations to participate in the evaluation process. The practice of avoiding costs may also bring forth other issues, such as rent-seeking behavior and conspiracies. Reducing private costs and the tendency of the three EIA stakeholders to evade social responsibility are intertwined in every EIA process. Their activities are as follows: The government is the lawmaker whose attitude toward the EIA organization determines how business owners react in the EIA process. The government inclination can be interpreted as a signal from which enterprises can determine the nature of the government, which helps the enterprise owners formulate their future actions. A similar relationship also exists among the government, EIA organizations, and enterprise entities. Fundamentally, the correlations between the EIA stakeholders are determined by their socio-economic situation, namely, the economic costs and benefits they encounter. In this article, signaling game theory derived from the classic game theory is applied to describe the EIA process in China by analyzing the activities of the stakeholders and searching for game equilibrium solutions. The optimal reaction schema for stakeholders was obtained by transforming the equilibrium. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of this article is to investigate preference heterogeneity for agri-environmental contracts among farmers in order to discuss potential policy improvements utilising heterogeneity.We used a choice experiment to elicit farmers’ stated preferences for afforestation contracts. Four attributes are investigated: pur- pose of afforestation, option of cancelling the contract,monitoring, and compensation level. All attributes present a potential conflict between farmers’ and authorities’ interests, which emphasises the importance of knowing how to handle these interests. A random parameter logit model shows that having the option to cancel the contract decreases farmers’ required compensation level and monitoring increases it. Furthermore, farmers are willing to accept a lower compensation when the aim is to protect biodiversity and ground water relative to recreation. Latent classmodels with class probability variables reveal discrete heterogeneity and support a division into four groups with divergent preferences. For example, a group of farmers who already have forest areas does not find the option of cancelling the contract important, whereas another group relying on the farm for income requires higher compen- sation. The findings indicate potential for efficiency gains from targeting the contracts.},

In this paper, we seek to better understand preferences for different combinations of assets that comprise (part of) the asset portfolio of a nation. In a study of coastal and marine natural assets, we test for the existence of weak or strong sustainability preferences using different compensation options (respectively produced capital and natural capital) offered to a sample of the public in Spain in the case of possible future oil spills. As a further element of this test, we provide an empirical reflection on Aldred (2002, 2006) and Turner (2007) who speculate that individuals may not view money as compensating for certain environmental losses whereas investments in social assets may offer a more acceptable compensation option. Our results do appear to circumscribe in some way the acceptability of investing in produced capital and reveal a tendency towards a preference for social capital compensation. Nevertheless, the size of the oil spill and the environmental beliefs of respondents also influence choices over the natural capital compensation option. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Public preferences and broader economic Values are therefore likely to play an increasingly important role in the management of such environmental resources. The purpose of this work was to use an environmental economics framework to estimate public preferences for different habitats within the North York Moors National Park, UK, and the economic: value associated with National Parks in the UK. Both heather moorland and semi-natural broadleaved woodland were highly valued by visitors to the Park, moorland primarily for recreation and woodland primarily for nature conservation. Contingent valuation revealed that whilst some people thought that increased revenue for the National Park should be raised by the Park itself by making more productive use of the land, a significant majority of visitors said they would be prepared to contribute additional revenue towards nature conservation in the National Park. A postal questionnaire revealed that this amounted to a mean value of pound 3.10 per individual per year. This compared with pound 119 per individual per year for all 11 National Parks obtained from an interview questionnaire. The results indicate that most visitors to the Park would be willing to provide additional revenue towards nature conservation, and that recreation in the Park could therefore be used in a beneficial way to maintain and enhance the Park's nature conservation value.

The CV method has come under considerable criticism on account of biases that are either inherent to, or generated by the survey process. The present study acknowledges those, and adopts techniques to either circumvent or then minimise them. The authors pay special attention to hypothetical bias, starting point bias, embedding effects and part-whole biases. The authors argue that indeed it is possible to improve the quality of a CV by using special survey as well as statistical techniques so that CV results can be used for the purposes of realistic decision making. This validation of the CV becomes an important objective of the study. Despite India being a developing country with medium to low income levels, the evidence suggested that people are willing to pay for preserving environmental amenities. Having statistically adjusted for embedding and anchoring effects, households are willing to pay exclusively for BNP, on average, Rs 7.5, per month, for the next five years. Extrapolating to the city of Bombay, this amounts to a substantial Rs 20 million each month for the next five years, or a present discounted value of in excess of Rs 1 billion, suggesting a strong interest in environmental conservation.},

The existing literature on environmental valuation is based on two distinct foundations. The ecological valuation methods derive values by a cost-of-production approach. Their common characteristic is the neglect of consumer preferences. The economic valuation methods focus on the exchange value of ecosystem services. Their common characteristic is that they are finally based on consumer preferences, and do not adequately take account of the complex internal structure of ecosystems. As the existing methods for the valuation of ecosystem services emphasize either the economic system or the ecosystem, the main objective of part 1 is to provide the conceptual foundations for a new method of valuation of ecosystem services, which deals simultaneously with the ecosystem, the economic system and society in a balanced way. Within a simple pre-industrial model it is shown how the interdependencies between the three subsystems influence values, and how values change over time. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In separate meta-analyses of the contingent valuation (CV) and hedonic pricing (HP) literature we examine which physical, socio-economic, and study characteristics determine the value of open space. The dependent variable in the CV meta-regression is defined as the value of open space per hectare per year in 2003 US$, and in the HP model as the percentage change in house price for a 10 m decrease in distance to open space. Using a multi-level modelling approach we find in both the CV and HP analyses that there is a positive and significant relationship between the value of urban open space and population density, indicating that scarcity and crowdedness matter, and that the value of open space does not vary significantly with income. Further, urban parks are more highly valued than other types of urban open space (forests, agricultural and undeveloped land) and methodological differences in study design have a large influence on estimated values from both CV and HP. We also find important regional differences in preferences for urban open space, which suggests that the potential for transferring estimated values between regions is likely to be limited. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Alternatively, they also question whether the national parks have sufficient value to contribute to citizens' welfare in order to recieve continuing support from the government. Hence, the purpose of this research is to estimate the use and preservation values of natural and/or cultural resources in five distinctive national parks, using a dichotomous choice contingent valuation method. The empirical results show that natural and/or cultural resources of the sample national parks possessed considerable use and preservation values, outweighing current admission fees and maintenance costs per visitor. Thus, these values provide enough justification for the national park authority to increase admission fees to maintain the quality of natural environment, and avoid degrading natural resources in the event of no assistance by the government. The findings may provide guidance to national park managers and practitioners who establish pricing policies. The results also show that values of natural and/or cultural resources were different across five distinctive national parks, indicating the possibility of employing differential admission fees according to park characteristics. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study applies a generalized multinomial logit model to interpret the results of a discrete choice experiment administered to a representative sample of 1001 Poles. The questionnaire included three physical attributes: protecting the most ecologically valuable forest ecosystems, reducing litter in forests, and improving recreation infrastructure. The selection of these attributes was motivated by extensive qualitative research regarding to what indicators of biodiversity, nature protection and recreation possibilities people are most sensitive. The fourth attribute was monetary, that is, additional costs associated with the new programs that would have to be financed out of increased taxes. The results allowed for an estimation of implicit prices regarding the choice attributes and calculating welfare measures of specific forest management scenarios. The study revealed interesting connections between respondents' current forest recreation patterns and the importance they place on the various attributes of forests. The paper particularly focuses on respondents' unobserved and observed preference heterogeneity, as well as scale heterogeneity, and the study demonstrates how heterogeneity can improve the models and provide insight into how users and non-users of forests may benefit from introducing a particular policy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Ecosystem services valuation has achieved considerable prominence in research and policy circles in recent years. This paper reviews the studies that have tried to estimate the value of forest ecosystem services. Broadly, this study addresses the following questions: (1) What insights do these studies provide on the value of forest ecosystems? (2) What lessons do they offer from an economic and policy perspective? (3) What are the shortcomings of the existing studies, and what are the challenges and issues for future research? Evidence from a cross section of forest sites, countries and regions suggests that not only the total valuation of ecosystem services varies widely across studies but also the valuation of individual services. This variation suggests that policies to conserve ecosystems and their services should emphasise local contexts and values. This paper concludes by discussing the shortcomings of existing studies, and suggests that, among other things, future research should focus on the neglected ecosystem services, 'disservices', assess the role of dynamic factors and environmental catastrophes on the provision of ecosystem services, and assess the benefits of keeping forests intact versus converting them to alternative uses. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Coastal wetlands are some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, supporting diverse natural functions and providing important services to human societies. In this context, strategies have recently been developed to maintain these coastal wetlands in a sustainable way, however, wetlands are under pressure, particularly due to land use changes, because they have traditionally been treated as areas of low economic value or even as risky areas for human health. As a result, wetlands have suffered some loss and substantial habitat alteration, which are associated with high social costs. Thus, inventories are required to identify these environments and define and value their services to obtain appropriate information relevant to conservation strategies. This research introduces a spatial component for classifying wetland types and further evaluation of their ecosystem services (ES), assessing their current distribution and extent using standardized remote sensing techniques for wetland mapping. A value transfer approach was performed to generate baseline estimates of the ecosystem services provided by wetlands, validating it through a meta-analysis of a database of wetland estimates, with northwest Mexico wetlands as case study. We found that saltmarshes were the most important wetland in terms of covered area and also that socio-economic variables, such as income, are important in explaining wetland values. The results show that in 2003, a value of 1 billion USD per year was delivered to the local citizens by the surrounding wetlands provided as services and benefits. In a spatially explicit manner, this approach highlights the contribution made by wetlands to the well-being of communities. We argue that in the future design of management plans, the conservation of these environments should be a priority, regarding both, ecologically and economically views.},

This method is based on a set of repeated valuation questions and is used to study relations between the components of environmental goods. We propose its application to public coastal sites in south-western France. We show that programmes regarding the ocean, beaches and forests are generally independent of one another. In order to stress the heterogeneity of users, two separate models are assessed. The way time is taken into account then appears to be one of the most interesting sources of divergence between tourists and residents. Individual WTP per day also varies. This confirms that beaches used by residents provide high economic benefits although they generate little indirect revenue. Finally, contingent valuation appears to be a useful alternative for analyzing the multiple dimensions of a public policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Little research, however, has modeled predictions of attitudes toward fees on both the intention to pay (WTP) and stated payment amount ($WTP) simultaneously. This article addresses that knowledge gap using onsite survey data from 1068 recreationists at the McDonald-Dunn forest in Oregon. Attitudes toward paying an annual fee at this forest were directly associated with WTP and were among the strongest predictors of WTP. Respondents with supportive attitudes toward paying the annual fee were more willing to pay than those who were opposed. The strength of attitudes also influenced WTP, with those respondents having stronger opposition being least likely to pay. Attitudes toward paying a fee were indirectly (i.e., mediation) related to the stated payment amount ($WTP), suggesting that payment is influenced by intention to pay (WTP), and this intention is partially a function of attitudes about fees. ?? 2012 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Ume??.},

We examine contingent valuation studies that implemented scope tests to determine what they imply about the adequacy of response to scope. We find that in the vast majority of studies, the magnitude of response cannot be assessed. Only three studies permit such an assessment: Samples and Hollyer (1990), Diamond et al. (1993) and Chapman et al. (2009). The first two papers find that responses to their surveys did not vary adequately with scope. The third study passed the standard scope test, but we show that the magnitude of response in this study is inadequate by straightforward methods of assessment and cannot be explained by diminishing marginal utility or substitution. More research is needed on this issue, including wider application of adding-up tests on incremental parts, as well as the development of other methods that permit an assessment of the magnitude of response or other tests of rationality. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The elicited conservation values concern two endangered species; the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta and the monk seal Monachus monachus. The findings of this pilot study indicate that the main reasons for respondents' participation are prior knowledge of species and attitude to management options. More importantly, they show evidence of sensitivity to the method of payment. Despite respondents state a lower Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) when a collective mechanism is used in place of a voluntary one, they are more likely to participate in the scheme with a higher certainty. Finally, the elicited WTP values of the two marine endangered species confirm that there is potential for internal funding which could sustain the operation of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos (NMPZ) in Greece. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Most of the literature is concerned with assessing the benefits that could be gained by changing land management practices. Some research assessed values of ecosystem services to the NZ public. Trade-offs in land-use decisions are highlighted. However, critical gaps in the literature could suggest the impediment of integration of the ecosystem concept into decision-making. The full range of ecosystem services, benefits, and beneficiaries had not been covered, and the scope of research is patchy, i.e. limited in spatial and temporal scale. In addition, there is a need to broaden the scope of research to include social and cultural aspects, and link the supply and demand for ecosystem services.

   abstract = {The urban land use planning literature is rife with criticism of the deficiency of planning regimes in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, little is known of the magnitude of the economic impact of these land use planning regimes, leading to a lack of clear evidence to direct policy reforms. This study examines the economic benefit of Ghana's land use planning regime to provide quantitative evidence of the magnitude of its benefits to contribute to the debate in the literature as well as aid policy formulation. This study found that land use planning in Ghana contributes considerable benefits in residential areas. A substantial portion of these benefits emanates from tarred roads and concrete drains, electricity, formalized titles and pipe-borne water, while worship centres generate no benefits. This implies that the former four attributes are central to generating maximum benefits from planning in residential areas in Ghana. The study recommends that Ghana's ongoing planning reforms should place the provision of these facilities at the heart of residential neighbourhood developments, while steps are taken to review the necessity of requirements (attributes) such as community parks, schools and worship centres in residential communities. To aid the assessment of the suitability of land use planning requirements, it is further suggested that the benefit of the planning regime should be evaluated in the context of the cost of compliance with its requirements and urban dwellers' socio-economic conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have indicated a broad-based support for open space preservation and protection. Research also has characterized the public values and rationale that underlie the widespread support for open space. In recognition of the widespread public support for open space, various levels of government have implemented programs to provide public access to open space. There are many different types of open space, ranging from golf courses, ball parks, wildlife areas, and prairies, to name a few. This paper addresses questions related to the types of open space that should be prioritized by planners and natural resource managers. The results of this study are based on a stratified random sample of 5000 households in Illinois that were sent a questionnaire related to their support for various types of open space. Through a comparatively simple action grid analysis, the open space types that should be prioritized for public access include forest areas, stream corridors, wildlife habitat, and lakes/ponds. These were the open space types rated of the highest importance, yet were also the open space types rated the lowest in respondent satisfaction. This kind of analysis does not require the technical expertise of other options for land-use prioritizations (e.g., conjoint analysis, contingent valuation), yet provides important policy directives for planners. Although open space funds often allow for purchase of developed sites such as golf courses, ball parks, and community parks, this study indicates that undeveloped (or nature-based) open space lands are most needed in Illinois.},

   abstract = {Nature in cities is increasingly preserved or created to improve urban environmental quality. Green space provision is proceeding apace in many Chinese cities. Cost-benefit analysis of such projects is needed to justify the level of investment and the use of public funds. This paper assessed the use pattern of urban green spaces in the new Zhuhai city in south China, and employed the contingent valuation method to estimate the non-market leisure value of an ambitious new urban greening project. A questionnaire survey of 850 randomly chosen households was conducted. Some 65.7% of respondents used public green spaces for leisure frequently and young residents aged 20-30 were less frequent users. The new greening project was strongly supported for its leisure and ecological values. The logit regression model indicated that household income and bid amount would affect individual willingness-to-pay (WTP). The mean WTP was RMB161.84 per household per year, translated into an aggregate leisure value of RMB12.3 million per year. The net present value is projected to be RMB-32.94 million and the discounted benefit-cost ratio is 0.88 when other benefits were not included. The findings confirmed community support and verified the application of cost-benefit analysis in projects related to non-market public goods, and the applicability of contingent valuation method in the Chinese context. The study could serve as the basis to launch other cost-benefits analysis of nature conservation projects which need urgent attention in view of the rapid pace of urbanization in China to contribute to sustainable city goals. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Economic valuation of the amenities of urban open spaces will lend support to urban planning and development. In the absence of an explicit market for these amenities, the hedonic approach is often employed. Hitherto there have been a relatively limited number of studies on hedonic valuation of urban open spaces in China. This paper employs Geographic Field Model (GFM) to specify the externalities of urban open spaces with regard to their specific scale of influence, and builds a GFM-based spatial hedonic model to value the environmental amenities. The GFM quantification of open space variables overcomes the potential bias caused by traditional distance measures without influence scale limitations and the discontinuousness of the dichotomous index indicating the proximity to open space. A GFM-based spatial hedonic analysis was conducted in Wuhan, a metropolis in central China with various open spaces. Proximity to the Changjiang River recreation space and the East Lake were found to exert remarkable and positive impacts on apartment price. But proximity to other lakes and rivers were not significant in the result. The study showed that city level parks have significant amenity values, but district level parks do not. The amenity values of these urban open spaces were demonstrated by measuring the value they added to apartment prices. Some unexpected findings, such as the positive effect of noise and the powerful impact of floor height on housing price, may be common rules in densely populated cities in China. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Fast economic and social changes in recent years in China have brought massive expansion, redevelopment, and restructuring of cities. These changes offer cities the opportunity to improve environmental quality through urban green spaces (UGSs) and to address the challenges of meeting community aspirations. This study explored peoples' minds concerning UGSs in Guangzhou city in south China in relation to the following: (1) knowledge and perception of 25 ecosystem services and 8 negative impacts; (2) attitude toward site condition and management; (3) expectation of landscape design; and (4) preference ranking of venues. A questionnaire was designed to solicit opinions from 340 respondents randomly chosen from residents living in the study area. The results indicated widespread recognition of ecosystem services and strong support of UGS programs. Negative responses were weakly expressed. Amelioration of urban microclimate and environmental quality were emphasized. Environmental functions stressed in publicity programs, together with aggravating environmental problems in the city, tended to focus respondents' attention on UGS benefits. Wildlife habitat, species conservation and other natural ecosystem services drew limited concerns. Awareness of economic benefits was very low. Visual-landscape contributions with strong preference for naturalistic design and recreational benefits were highlighted. Compared with other countries, Guangzhou residents were characterized by visual-scenic-recreation orientation and pragmatic-utilitarian perception of UGSs, reflecting underlying differences in the understanding of inherent ecosystem services of green spaces. Relevant UGS policies and practices could adopt the approaches of market survey, citizen participation, and precision planning in order to meet increasingly mature and refined demands. Citizens' understanding of high-order ecosystem services could be enhanced to encourage appreciation of nature and their associated benefits.},

The main noise sources were identified and the noise-pollution levels were assessed along a pathway that is highly frequented by hikers in a natural park in the mountains of central Spain. The results showed noticeable soundscape degradation during the visitors' leisure experience (sound pressure levels increased approximately 4.5. dB from natural ambient levels). Visitors' voices and conversations were as great of a nuisance to themselves as were aircraft overflights and road traffic. Using the contingent valuation method, the willingness to pay for the financing of a programme aimed at mitigating noise in the park was estimated. The results showed that visitors would be willing to pay an entrance fee of approximately 1 euro if this noise-reduction programme were to be implemented in the park. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

To better understand the importance of a forested urban park we employ the Street Tree Resource Assessment Tool for Urban Forest Managers (STRATUM) to investigate the value of services provided by trees in Allan Gardens, a historic public park in downtown Toronto, Canada. A full inventory, conducted in 2008, found 309 trees representing 43 species. Park trees provided 26,326. USD in annual benefits (DOLLAR16,665 environmental; DOLLAR9661 aesthetic) during 2008, and delivered a benefit-to-cost ratio of 3.4:1. Tree size and leaf area are larger in Allan Gardens when compared with trees growing in other Toronto parks and across the city as a whole. The flow of benefits from Allan Gardens' urban forest is heavily dependent upon Norway Maple (Acer platanoides), a finding mirrored across much of Toronto's urban forest. Norway Maple provides the greatest overall annual benefits (DOLLAR4846 total; DOLLAR113 per tree) and as a species contributes 17.5% of the environmental and 20% of aesthetic value provided by trees in the park. This work offers a model to urban planners, providing a straightforward methodology for quantifying the value of nature in public city spaces, in the form of treed parks. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The sample consists of 190 visitors to an urban Spanish park. The mean willingness to pay estimated was 12.67€ per year. The results also indicated that moral norm was the major factor in predicting behavioral intention, followed by attitudes. The new relations established between the components of the Theory of Planned Behavior show that social norms significantly determine the attitudes, moral norms and perceived behavioral control of individuals. The proportion of explained variance shows that the inclusion of moral norms improves the explanatory power of the original model of the Theory of Planned Behavior (32-40%). Community-based social marketing and local campaigns are the main strategies that should be followed by land managers with the objective of promoting responsible, pro-environmental attitudes as well as a greater willingness to pay for this type of goods. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper uses means-end chain techniques to examine whether green space users reflect their own personal values through the benefits and attributes they perceive in this type of good. The results show key factors to be opportunities for sport and recreational activities, improvement of physical and mental well-being and enjoyment of landscape beauty. Other values, both individual (personal enjoyment and quality of life) and social (respect for others and a clearer conscience) also emerge. Further analysis to determine whether values differ according to whether or not the visitor assigns a monetary value to the green space showed higher environmental and social awareness to be associated with higher willingness to pay for peri-urban green space. Thus, the greater the perceived environmental values and the higher their subsequent monetary valuation, the more effective environmental protection and conservation policies are likely to be.

The deconstruction of green spaces cause negative externalities e.g. the loss of non-priced benefits. In land-use planning, therefore, amenity values should be systematically assessed and measured commensurately, i.e. in monetary terms with material values. This paper discusses the suitability of the contingent valuation method in assessing urban forest benefits, and presents the main results of an empirical study conducted in Joensuu, the capital of North Carelia, Finland. The study was designed to measure the use-values of urban wooded recreation areas, and the residents' willingness to pay for small forest parks contributing to the quality of the housing environment. The results suggest that most visitors were willing to pay for the use of wooded recreation areas. Furthermore, approximately half of the respondents were willing to pay to prevent the conversion of forested parks to another land-use. The results can be used to assess the profitability of the management of urban forests. In addition, the results are useful in assessing the value of green space benefits in different land use options.},

   abstract = {Urban development projects may cause loss of amenity values of green areas, which should be taken into consideration in planning. Therefore, quantitative information on residents' valuation concerning urban forests is needed for assessing urban land use. The purpose of this investigation was to study the valuation of urban forests in two different urban environments Joensuu and Salo, Finland. The aims were to study the attitudes towards and benefits related to the use of urban forests and, in particular, to measure the valuations in monetary terms using contingent valuation, i.e. measure the residents' willingness-to-pay for larger wooded recreation areas and for small forested parks. Urban forests were seen in both towns as clearly producing positive benefits rather than causing negative effects. The negative features of forests were related to the management of the areas rather than their existence. The main values were related to nature and social functions of forests. In contrast, timber production achieved a distinctively low priority in both study towns. The results stress the importance of defining urban forest policies for municipalities in Finland. More than two-thirds of the respondents were willing to pay for the use of recreation areas. Good location and active management raised the average WTP. Moreover, approximately half of the respondents were willing to pay for preventing construction in urban forests. The results also show that the monetary value of amenity benefits in recreation areas is much higher than the present maintenance costs. The examples concerning the advantageousness of construction on green areas suggest that a limit could be found where the infill of housing areas is not worthwhile from the point of view of society, if the losses of green space benefits are taken into account.},

   abstract = {This study presents data on the influence of the land cover type on soil carbon stocks in an Oxisol in southwestern Amazon, Acre, Brazil, under three land cover types: mature forest, pasture and rubber tree plantation. Total soil carbon was calculated using carbon concentration in soil and soil bulk density. Accumulated soil carbon stock up to 1 m depth was greater in mature forest (96 Mg ha-1), followed by pasture (79.7 Mg ha-1) and then by rubber tree plantation (56.3 Mg ha-1); also the greatest carbon accumulation in the surface layers was in pasture. Such results demonstrate that we need not only carbon stocks information by soil type, but also precise information on the land cover classification within a region in order to generate better soil carbon stocks estimations. Also, it is important to notice that mature forest conversion to other land covers can be the source to the atmosphere of about 20 to 40% of the carbon stocked in the soil previously.},

Também avalia o perfil típico do visitante e as mudanças sociais, econômicas e ambientais sobre a população local, residente no entorno do Parque.\nA pesquisa in loco de avaliação monetária do uso direto para fins recreativos do Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros foi empreendida em dois períodos típicos, de forma a se evitar problemas da sazonalidade. O primeiro período avaliado foi durante o período ensolarado e de férias. O segundo período avaliado foi durante o mês de novembro, época de aulas e geralmente com chuvas.\nForam aplicados 281 questionários, contendo perguntas relevantes para a utilização do Método do Custo de Viagem. A pesquisa incluiu ainda um estudo do perfil do visitante e os seus gastos e hábitos durante a permanência no parque e seu entorno.\nComo conclusão, pode-se verificar que as políticas públicas de criação e manutenção de Parques Nacionais e sítios de interesse ambiental abertos à visitação não se coadunam com o valor econômico atribuído a estes, e apenas em anos recentes passaram a incorporar a questão das comunidades locais e no seu aproveitamento e engajamento na conservação, oferta de infraestrutura turística e melhoria nas condições de acesso ao local.},

   abstract = {How does knowledge management (KM) by a government agency responsible for environmental impact assessment (EIA) potentially contribute to better environmental assessment and management practice? Staff members at government agencies in charge of the EIA process are knowledge workers who perform judgement-oriented tasks highly reliant on individual expertise, but also grounded on the agency's knowledge accumulated over the years. Part of an agency's knowledge can be codified and stored in an organizational memory, but is subject to decay or loss if not properly managed. The EIA agency operating in Western Australia was used as a case study. Its KM initiatives were reviewed, knowledge repositories were identified and staff surveyed to gauge the utilisation and effectiveness of such repositories in enabling them to perform EIA tasks. Key elements of KM are the preparation of substantive guidance and spatial information management. It was found that treatment of cumulative impacts on the environment is very limited and information derived from project follow-up is not properly captured and stored, thus not used to create new knowledge and to improve practice and effectiveness. Other opportunities for improving organizational learning include the use of after-action reviews. The learning about knowledge management in EIA practice gained from Western Australian experience should be of value to agencies worldwide seeking to understand where best to direct their resources for their own knowledge repositories and environmental management practice. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The primary aim of EASETECH is to perform life-cycle assessment (LCA) of complex systems handling heterogeneous material flows. The objectives of this paper are to describe the EASETECH framework and the calculation structure. The main novelties compared to other LCA software are as follows. First, the focus is put on material flow modelling, as each flow is characterised as a mix of material fractions with different properties and flow compositions are computed as a basis for the LCA calculations. Second, the tool has been designed to allow for the easy set-up of scenarios by using a toolbox, the processes within which can handle heterogeneous material flows in differentways and have different emission calculations. Finally, tools for uncertainty analysis are provided, enabling the user to parameterise systems fully and propagate probability distributions through Monte Carlo analysis.},

   abstract = {There is growing interest in creating empirically grounded agent based models (ABMs) to simulate land use change at a variety of spatio-temporal scales. The development of land use change models is challenging, as there is a need to connect representations of human behavioural processes to simulations of the biophysical environment. This paper presents a new agent-based modelling framework (Aporia) that has the goal of reducing the complexity and difficulty of constructing high-fidelity land use models. Building on earlier conceptual developments for modelling land use change and the provision of ecosystem services, Aporia was designed to be modular, flexible and open, using a declarative, compositional approach to create complex models from subcomponents. The framework can be tightly or loosely coupled with multiple vegetation models, it can be set up to evaluate a range of ecosystem service indicators, and it can be calibrated for a range of different landscape-scale case studies and modelling styles. The framework is released under an Open Source licence, and can be freely re-used and modified to form the basis of new models. We illustrate this with two case studies implemented using Aporia, exploring different socio-economic scenarios and behavioural characteristics on the land use decisions of Swiss and Scottish farmers. We also discuss the benefits of frameworks in terms of their flexibility, expandability, verification and transparency.},

   abstract = {Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was first introduced in Pakistan based on the Environmental Protection Ordinance 1983. The EIA process was further strengthened under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997, which became operational under EIA Regulations 2000. Despite a sound legal basis and comprehensive guidelines, evidence suggests that EIA has not yet evolved satisfactorily in Pakistan. An evaluation of the EIA system against systematic evaluation criteria, based on interviews with EIA approval authorities, consulting firms and experts, reveals various shortcomings of the EIA system. These mainly include; inadequate capacity of EIA approval authorities, deficiencies in screening and scoping, poor EIA quality, inadequate public participation and weak monitoring. Overall, EIA is used presently as a project justification tool rather than as a project planning tool to contribute to achieving sustainable development. Whilst shortcomings are challenging, central government has recently shown a high degree of commitment to the environmental protection by making EIA compulsory for all the public sector projects likely to have adverse environmental impacts. The paper identifies opportunities for taking advantage of the current environment for strengthening the EIA process. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper describes an evaluation of EIA in Colombia, using the model and the control mechanisms proposed and applied in other countries by Christopher Wood and Ortolano. The evaluation criteria used are based on Principles of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice, such as effectiveness and control features, and they were contrasted with the opinions of a panel of Colombian EIA experts as a means of validating the results of the study. The results found that EIA regulations in Colombia were ineffective because of limited scope, inadequate administrative support and the inexistence of effective control mechanisms and public participation. This analysis resulted in a series of recommendations regarding the further development of the EIA system in Colombia with a view to improving its quality and effectiveness. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Environmental cost-benefit analysis (ECBA) is used for the social evaluation of investment projects and policies that involve significant environmental impacts. Economic valuation of environmental impacts forms one of the critical steps of ECBA. We develop a new method for this purpose, which does not require price estimation for environmental impacts using stated or revealed preference methods. Our approach is based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is modified to ECBA by using absolute shadow prices instead of relative prices. We also discuss how the method can be used for sensitive analysis in ECBA. We illustrate the method by means of a hypothetical numerical example. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Vietnam has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and has achieved significant socio-economic development in recent years. However this growth is placing increased pressure on an already depleted natural environment. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is recognised by the Government and international organizations as an important tool in the management of the impacts of future development on the country's natural resource base. The Government's commitment to EIA has been demonstrated through the development and adoption of the Law on Environment Protection (Revised) in 2005 which sets out the requirements for EIA and which represents a major step in the development of a robust legislative framework for EIA in Vietnam. The Law on Environment Protection (Revised) 2005 has now been operational for several years and we have undertaken an evaluation of the resulting EIA system in Vietnam. We argue that while significant improvements have been achieved in the EIA policy framework, an important gap remains between EIA theory and practice. We contend that the basis of the current EIA legislation is strong and that future developments of the EIA system in Vietnam should focus on improving capacity of EIA practitioners rather than further substantial legislative change. Such improvements would allow the Vietnamese EIA system to emerge as an effective and efficient tool for environmental management in Vietnam and as a model EIA framework for other developing countries. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Changes in forest landscapes resulting from road construction have increased remarkably in the last few years. On the other hand, the sustainable management of forest resources can only be achieved through a well-organized road network. In order to minimize the environmental impacts of forest roads, forest road managers must design the road network efficiently and environmentally as well. Efficient planning methodologies can assist forest road managers in considering the technical, economic, and environmental factors that affect forest road planning. This paper describes a three-stage methodology using the Delphi method for selecting the important criteria, the Analytic Hierarchy Process for obtaining the relative importance of the criteria, and finally, a spatial multi-criteria evaluation in a geographic information system (GIS) environment for identifying the lowest-impact road network alternative. Results of the Delphi method revealed that ground slope, lithology, distance from stream network, distance from faults, landslide susceptibility, erosion susceptibility, geology, and soil texture are the most important criteria for forest road planning in the study area. The suitability map for road planning was then obtained by combining the fuzzy map layers of these criteria with respect to their weights. Nine road network alternatives were designed using PEGGER, an ArcView GIS extension, and finally, their values were extracted from the suitability map. Results showed that the methodology was useful for identifying road that met environmental and cost considerations. Based on this work, we suggest future work in forest road planning using multi-criteria evaluation and decision making be considered in other regions and that the road planning criteria identified in this study may be useful.},

   abstract = {Background, aim, and scope Impact assessment can be completed with the help of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) as a part of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and External Cost Assessment methods. These methods help, for project and product classifications, to protect human health and the environment. Comparison of different impact assessment methods along parallel evaluations of real air pollution case studies helps to detect similarities and dependencies between them. The comparison helps and supports the work in both areas by mutually exploiting the merits of both methods. On the other hand, the detected similarities and dependencies also support the accuracy of the assessment work. Materials and methods Two impact assessment methods are compared to detect the dependencies between them. These are: the damage-oriented Life Cycle Impact Assessment method Eco-indicator 99 (EI99) and the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CAFE CBA) carried out within the framework of the Clean Air for Europe Programme of the European Union. Arithmetic comparison of the two methods’ impact indicators is carried out in order to show how differently they assess and evaluate the environmental impacts of the same pollutants. Moreover, air pollution inventories of five industrialized cities in Poland are evaluated in parallel with the two impact assessment methods. The uncertainties of the two methods are also considered and Monte Carlo simulations are completed to obtain probability intervals of impact indicators and overall mean values of the generated populations. Results and discussion The arithmetic comparison of the impact indicators shows a strict correlation between the two impact assessment methods. This correlation is confirmed by results of the parallel evaluation of the real case studies. The comparison of the overall mean values obtained by the Monte Carlo simulations also shows a clear dependency between the results of the two impact assessment methods. After detecting the dependencies between the two methods, the best guess values of the EI99 indicator are selected and applied to make a ranking of the air pollutants and their emission sources for an industrialized Polish city. Conclusions It can be concluded that the detected correlation between the two methods (EI99 and CAFE CBA) supports and helps the accuracy of the impact assessment. If the uncertainties of the methods are also considered, it is proved for the examples of real case studies that they correlate in their results. On the other hand, the best guess of the EI99 indicators can be used to rank emissions according to their relative damage to human health and the ecosystem, and to locate emission sources. These results help decision-makers to conclude an efficient environmental conscious policy.},

   abstract = {Large-scale public infrastructure projects have featured in China's modernization course since the early 1980s. During the early stages of China's rapid economic development, public attention focused on the economic and social impact of high-profile construction projects. In recent years, however, we have seen a shift in public concern toward the environmental and ecological effects of such projects, and today governments are required to provide valid environmental impact assessments prior to allowing large-scale construction. The official requirement for the monitoring of environmental conditions has led to an increased number of debates in recent years regarding the effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Governmental Environmental Audits (GEAs) as environmental safeguards in instances of large-scale construction. Although EIA and GEA are conducted by different institutions and have different goals and enforcement potential, these two practices can be closely related in terms of methodology. This article cites the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway as an instance in which EIA and GEA offer complementary approaches to environmental impact management. This study concludes that the GEA approach can serve as an effective follow-up to the EIA and establishes that the EIA lays a base for conducting future GEAs. The relationship that emerges through a study of the Railway's construction calls for more deliberate institutional arrangements and cooperation if the two practices are to be used in concert to optimal effect.},

The main aim was to identify different follow-up activities during planning, construction and operation of rail infrastructure. Additional aims were to identify limiting factors for effective environmental follow-up and to provide suggestions on how SRA follow-up can better be used as an organisational learning tool. The follow-up proved to be highly influenced by Environmental Management System and was mainly used for showing compliance with legal regulations or contract requirements. Use of environmental monitoring data was limited to the specific project in which the follow-up was carried out, possibly because of the project-based structure of the organisation following rail deregulation. Theory on organisational learning was applied in the study to discuss how to improve the distribution and use of follow-up data.

   abstract = {Serra do Mar, in Southeastern Brazil, is an extremely diverse and rich environment characterized by intense rainfall and steep slopes covered by tropical rainforest. A number of roads, highways, railways, pipelines, and transmission lines cross this zone. A new highway that has been approved by the São Paulo State environment authorities is currently under construction. During the approval phase, the issue of ensuring proper implementation of mitigation measures arose as a significant concern. As a consequence, an innovative institutional arrangement has been set up for following-up, by which a multi-institutional multidisciplinary team performs weekly inspection tours, whereas the project owner hired its own consultant to oversee the construction, putting the contractor under strict scrutiny. Among the most significant issues addressed, the following are particularly relevant: (1) erosion and sediment yield; (2) river siltation; (3) slope stability; (4) excavated soil and rock disposal; (5) management of water pumped from tunneling; and (6) minimizing habitat loss. Results show that strict environmental supervision can effectively ensure that environmental impacts can be maintained within the limits of predicted impacts or legal requirements. Furthermore, this case showed that careful review of environmental impact studies and the establishment of detailed terms and conditions to be fulfilled by the proponent during the construction phase are necessary conditions for a successful follow-up. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The effect of roads on forests is ambiguous. Many studies conclude that building and upgrading roads increases pressure on forests but some find that new and better roads may reduce the rate of deforestation. In this paper we use satellite remote sensing images of forest cover in Jiangxi Province, China, to test whether the existence and the size of roads (ranging from expressways to tertiary roads) in 1995 affected the level of forest cover in 2000 or the rate of change between 1995 and 2000. To account for road access for each of our 1km2 ("pixel") units of forest cover we measure whether or not and what type of roads penetrate the "watershed" in which the pixel lies. These watersheds allow more plausible measures of accessibility than do traditional "crowfly" distance measures that ignore topography. To account for possible confounding we also use 12 additional covariates: geographic and climatic variables (e.g., elevation, slope, rainfall, temperature, soil properties); demographic and economic variables (e.g., local population and GDP per square kilometer); and distance variables (e.g., distance to the nearest provincial capital). Although simple univariate OLS regressions show that forest levels are lower and deforestation rates higher either when there is a road, or when there is a higher quality road, these results are not robust. Controlling for all of the covariates and also using recently developed covariate matching techniques to estimate treatment effects, we find that roads in China's Jiangxi Province can most safely be described as having no impact on the level of forests and no impact on the rate of deforestation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Transport infrastructure has a wide array of effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and road and railway networks are increasingly being associated with a loss of biodiversity worldwide. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are two legal frameworks that concern physical planning, with the potential to identify, predict, mitigate and/or compensate transport infrastructure effects with negative impacts on biodiversity. The aim of this study was to review the treatment of ecological impacts in environmental assessment of transport infrastructure plans and projects. A literature review on the topic of EIA, SEA, biodiversity and transport infrastructure was conducted, and 17 problem categories on the treatment of biodiversity were formulated by means of a content analysis. A review of environmental impact statements and environmental reports (EIS/ER) produced between 2005 and 2013 in Sweden and the UK was then conducted using the list of problems as a checklist. The results show that the treatment of ecological impacts has improved substantially over the years, but that some impacts remain problematic; the treatment of fragmentation, the absence of quantitative analysis and that the impact assessment study area was in general delimited without consideration for the scales of ecological processes. Actions to improve the treatment of ecological impacts could include improved guidelines for spatial and temporal delimitation, and the establishment of a quantitative framework including tools, methods and threshold values. Additionally, capacity building and further method development of EIA and SEA friendly spatial ecological models can aid in clarifying the costs as well as the benefits in development/biodiversity tradeoffs. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Wetlands generally provide significant ecosystem services and function as important harbors of biodiversity. To ensure that these habitats are conserved, an efficient means of identifying wetlands at risk of conversion is needed, especially in the southern United States where the rate of wetland loss has been highest in recent decades. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to develop a model to predict the risk of wetland habitat loss as a function of wetland features and landscape context. Fates of wetland habitats from 1992 to 1997 were obtained from the National Resources Inventory for the U.S. Forest Service's Southern Region, and land-cover data were obtained from the National Land Cover Data. We randomly selected 70% of our 40 617 observations to build the model (n = 28 432), and randomly divided the remaining 30% of the data into five Test data sets (n = 2437 each). The wetland and landscape variables that were important in the model, and their relative contributions to the model's predictive ability (100 = largest, 0 = smallest), were land-cover/ land-use of the surrounding landscape (100.0), size and proximity of development patches within 570 m (39.5), land ownership (39.1), road density within 570 m (37.5), percent woody and herbaceous wetland cover within 570 m (27.8), size and proximity of development patches within 5130 m (25.7), percent grasslands/herbaceous plants and pasture/hay cover within 5130 m (21.7), wetland type (21.2), and percent woody and herbaceous wetland cover within 1710 m (16.6). For the five Test data sets, Kappa statistics (0.40, 0.50, 0.52, 0.55, 0.56; P < 0.0001), area-under-the-receiver-operating-curve (AUC) statistics (0.78, 0.82, 0.83, 0.83, 0.84; P < 0.0001), and percent correct prediction of wetland habitat loss (69.1, 80.4, 81.7, 82.3, 83.1) indicated the model generally had substantial predictive ability across the South. Policy analysts and land-use planners can use the model and associated maps to prioritize at-risk wetlands for protection, evaluate wetland habitat connectivity, predict future conversion of wetland habitat based on projected land-use trends, and assess the effectiveness of wetland conservation programs.},

   abstract = {The objective of this paper is to examine the off-site benefits, as capitalized into housing values, of protecting 1.6 million acres of Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) in the state of New Mexico, United States. In light of petitions filed by various U.S. states to maintain the status of IRAs as roadless lands, spatial hedonic price models are estimated and used to calculate the implicit value of IRAs in New Mexico. Findings show that a two-stage least squares (2-SLS), robust spatial-lag model is the most appropriate econometric representation of the hedonic price function, and that IRA lands are a significant and positive determinant of house value. After controlling for the presence of Wilderness Areas (WAs) and other characteristics, results indicate that, on average, there is a 5.6% gain in the property value of a house from being located in, or adjacent to, a Census tract with IRAs. In the aggregate, this gain represents 3.5% of the value of all owner-occupied units in New Mexico ($1.9 billion in capitalized value, or an annualized value in perpetuity of $95 million, assuming a 5% interest rate).

The information generated by the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in impact identification and prediction stages of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is used in the assessment of impact significance by the computation of a set of impact indices. For each environmental component (e.g., air pollution, water resources, biological resources), impact indices are calculated based on the spatial distribution of impacts. A case study of impact evaluation of a proposed highway in Central Portugal illustrates the application of the methodology and shows its capabilities to be adapted to the particular characteristics of a given EIA problem. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

   abstract = {Some twenty years ago, Harvard Business School economist and strategy professor Michael Porter challenged conventional wisdom about the impact of environmental regulation on business by declaring that well-designed regulation could actually enhance competitiveness. The traditional view of environmental regulation held by virtually all economists until that time was that requiring firms to reduce an externality like pollution necessarily restricted their options and thus by definition reduced their profits. After all, if profitable opportunities existed to reduce pollution, profit-maximizing firms would already be taking advantage of them. Over the past twenty years, much has been written about what has since become known simply as the Porter Hypothesis. Yet even today, we continue to find conflicting evidence concerning the Porter Hypothesis, alternative theories that might explain it, and oftentimes a misunderstanding of what the Porter Hypothesis does and does not say. This article examines the key theoretical foundations and empirical evidence concerning the Porter Hypothesis, discusses its implications for the design of environmental regulations, and outlines directions for future research on the relationship between environmental regulation, innovation, and competitiveness.

   abstract = {As the developed world begins efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases, economic growth in developing countries is causing increased emissions from the developing world. Reducing these emissions while still enabling developing countries to grow requires the use of climate-friendly technologies in these countries. In most cases, these technologies are first created in high-income countries. Thus, the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual. Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies. Moreover, evidence suggests that some technologies, such as those enhancing energy efficiency, will diffuse to developing countries even without the aid of policy prescriptions, such as the CDM. This is important for assessing the potential emissions reductions of proposed CDM projects.},

   abstract = {In an attempt to achieve the positive externalities from a more knowledge-intensive economy, many developing countries have emphasized improvements in their science and technology (S&T) capabilities. China, in particular, has been experiencing an acceleration in its R&D intensity, causing many to wonder whether China is undergoing an S&T takeoff. In this paper, we simulate the effects of an S&T takeoff using a model of China that incorporates econometric estimates from 1500 industrial enterprises in China. We find that an S&T takeoff will lead to lower goods prices overall, but a larger drop in energy prices due to the energy-saving bias of R&D. The outcome is higher capital investment and economic growth; a substitution of energy for other factors of production; and greater energy consumption by households. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the economy-wide implications of a technology policy, recognizing that better technology does not necessarily imply a cleaner environment. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Recent efforts to endogenize technological change in climate policy models demonstrate the importance of accounting for the opportunity cost of climate R&D investments. Because the social returns to R&D investments are typically higher than the social returns to other types of investment, any new climate mitigation R&D that comes at the expense of other R&D investment may dampen the overall gains from induced technological change. Unfortunately, there has been little empirical work to guide modelers as to the potential magnitude of such crowding out effects. This paper considers both the private and social opportunity costs of climate R&D. Addressing private costs, we ask whether an increase in climate R&D represents new R&D spending, or whether some (or all) of the additional climate R&D comes at the expense of other R&D. Addressing social costs, we use patent citations to compare the social value of alternative energy research to other types of R&D that may be crowded out. Beginning at the industry level, we find no evidence of crowding out across sectors-that is, increases in energy R&D do not draw R&D resources away from sectors that do not perform R&D. Given this, we proceed with a detailed look at alternative energy R&D. Linking patent data and financial data by firm, we ask whether an increase in alternative energy patents leads to a decrease in other types of patenting activity. While we find that increases in alternative energy patents do result in fewer patents of other types, the evidence suggests that this is due to profit-maximizing changes in research effort, rather than financial constraints that limit the total amount of R&D possible. Finally, we use patent citation data to compare the social value of alternative energy patents to other patents by these firms. Alternative energy patents are cited more frequently, and by a wider range of other technologies, than other patents by these firms, suggesting that their social value is higher. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on the criticism that this idea has received from Latin American authors since the sixties, we show here how they could be understood today in Latin American countries, based on a stylization of the views of three important actors that participate in those policies: the research and development (R&D) manager, the STP evaluator and the STP analyst. Through this analysis, and in particular for the Brazilian case, we identify incoherences of national STP and we show how it is somewhat related to the pre- dominant triumphalist view concerning S&T. Also, we argue on the necessity of adopting a critical position regarding the Instrumental and the Determinist conceptions of Technoscience in order to make national STP more coherent in relation to the local specificities and to the changes already in course in several of the Latin American countries.},

This paper builds a theoretical foundation for the dynamics of knowledge sharing in private industry. We model an uncertain research process and ask how the incentives to license intermediate steps to rivals change over time as the research project approaches maturity. Such a dynamic approach allows us to analyze the interaction between how close the firms are to product market competition and how intense that competition is. We uncover a basic dynamic of sharing such that firms are less likely to share as they approach the product market. This dynamic is driven by a trade-off between three effects: the rivalry effect, the duplication effect and the speed effect. We show that this dynamic can be reversed when duopoly profits are sufficiently low or when the firms have asymmetric research capabilities. We also explore the implications of the model for patent policy, and compare policies targeting early research outcomes with policies targeting late research outcomes. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this study, we explore how the pattern of R&D collaboration within the industry community evolves over the technology life cycle. We propose that as the technology evolves from an initial emergence stage to subsequent stages of growth and maturity, there is a corresponding change in the opportunities and challenges confronting industry participants. This results in a shift not only in the relative propensities for internal and collaborative R&D, but also in the distribution of the different types of collaborative interactions involving research organizations, suppliers and users. The context for the study is the global semiconductor manufacturing industry from 1990 to 2010. During this period, the industry experienced exponential technological progress that was fueled by the deep ultraviolet (DUV) manufacturing technology. We draw upon a comprehensive archival dataset of more than 12,000 articles presented in industry technical conferences to analyze the pattern of collaborative R&D during the emergence, growth and maturity stages of the DUV technology. The observed trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry point to intriguing shifts in the efforts and interactions among suppliers, users and research organizations as they collectively push the technology envelope forward. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Resource exhaustion may occur under both regimes but is more likely to arise under open access. Under full property rights, positive resource rents increase expenditures and temporarily accelerate productivity growth, but also yield a higher resource price at least in the short-to-medium run. We characterize analytically the welfare effect of a regime switch induced by a failure in property rights enforcement: switching to open access is welfare reducing if the utility gain generated by the initial drop in the resource price is more than offset by the static and dynamic losses induced by reduced expenditure.},

Through structural estimation of a flexible innovation production function we provide a deeper understanding of firm-level drivers of complementarity between these two types of investments. Our analysis is based on a unique panel data set on the R&D and in-licensing expenditures of pharmaceutical firms. Our results suggest that internal R&D and in-licensing are neither complements nor substitutes. We find that the degree of complementarity is enhanced for firms with stronger absorptive capacity, economies of scope, and licensing experience.},

We introduce a climate cooperation model with endogenous R&D investments where countries protect their international competitiveness via border carbon adjust- ments (BCA). BCA raises the scope for cooperation and leads to a non-trivial relation between countries' prior R&D investments and participation in the coalition.We find that early investments in R&D render free-riding more attractive. Therefore, with delayed cooperation on emission abatement and ex-ante R&D investments, the outcome is often characterized by high participation but inefficiently low technology investments and abatement. &},

Ecological issues regarding energy, natural resources, pollution, and waste offer both competitive opportunities and constraints, and are changing the competitive landscape in many industries. Corporations can gain competitive advantage by managing ecological variables. This paper explains the concept of ‘environmental technologies’ as a competitive force and a tool for competitive advantage. Environmental technologies offer a new substantive orientation and a management process for minimizing ecological impacts of economic production while enhancing Competitiveness of firms. The practical application of environmental technologies is illustrated using a mini case example of 3M Corporation. Strategic implications of environmental technologies for competitiveness are explored.},

Unfortunately, agencies continue to employ private cost rather than social cost to evaluate environmental quality regulations. Furthermore, general equilibrium impacts and intertemporal effects of regulations are typically not included in the evaluation. In this paper we estimate the social cost of environmental quality regulations mandated by the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. We construct an econometric general equilibrium model of the United States to demonstrate that social cost estimates diverge sharply from private cost estimates. We also demonstrate that general equilibrium impacts are significant and pervasive and that intertemporal effects of the regulations, heretofore ignored, are significant.

   abstract = {The role of the common property concept and its policy implications as a tool in the economic analysis and solution of natural resources policy problems is examined. Common property is defined as resources subject to the rights of common use, but not to a specific use right held by several owners. The concept is considered as a second level decision system, aimed at maintaining and increasing welfare by continuously influencing decision making on the first level, the operating level, under constantly changing conditions. Whether welfare decreased under common property institutions or whether earlier societies over-used their resources because of common ownership is examined by looking back into economic history. It is concluded that the concept has been capable of satisfactory performance in the management of such natural resources as grazing and forest land. Elements of the common property concept are also being employed currently to solve groundwater and fisheries resource problems. It is suggested that this concept be broadened to include the application of the public trust doctrine to natural resources policy problems. This approach would have the advantage of forcing bureaucracies to take the interests of all common owners into account, and allow quality criteria to be incorporated into resource problem solutions.},

We set up a strategic model of R&D in which a polluter can deploy technologies developed in-house, or license technologies developed by specialist outsiders (an 'eco-industry'). Polluters exert R&D effort and may even develop redundant technologies to improve the terms on which they procure technology from outside. We find that, while regulatory bias has an ambiguous impact on the best-available technology, strategic delegation to systematically biased regulators can improve social welfare. ?? 2011.},

   abstract = {Exploring the tension between theory and practice regarding complexity\nand performance in contract design is especially relevant. The goal\nof this paper is to understand why simpler contracts may commonly\nbe preferred in practice despite being theoretically suboptimal.\nWe study a two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single\nbuyer to characterize the impact of contract complexity and asymmetric\ninformation on performance and to compare theoretical predictions\nto actual behavior in human subject experiments. In the experiments,\nthe computerized buyer faces a newsvendor setting and has better\ninformation on end-consumer demand than the human supplier. The supplier\noffers either a quantity discount contract (with two or three price\nblocks) or a price-only contract, contracts that are commonplace\nin practice, yet different in complexity. Results show that, contrary\nto theoretical predictions, quantity discounts do not necessarily\nincrease the supplier's profits. We also observe a more equitable\ndistribution of profits between the supplier and the buyer than what\ntheory predicts. These observations can be described with three decision\nbiases (the probabilistic choice bias, the reinforcement bias, and\nthe memory bias) and can be modeled using the experience-weighted\nattraction learning model. Our results demonstrate that simpler contracts,\nsuch as a price-only contract or a quantity discount contract with\na low number of price blocks, are sufficient for a supplier designing\ncontracts under asymmetric demand information.This paper was accepted\nby Christian Terwiesch, operations and supply chain management.},

   abstract = {This chapter seeks to understand the linkages between non-environmental polices and the environment, with a particular focus on taxation and subsidies. In order to understand the quite complex literature on this subject, we draw on the theory of the second best and the theory of optimal taxation. The thrust of the chapter is that there are multiple objectives and interactions among the various policies employed to meet them. In retrospect, one can always 'do better' in, say, improving efficiency and environmental quality without worsening the income distribution. What is interesting is to understand what the environmental impacts of the non-environmental policies have been and what lessons one can learn about the formulation of similar policies in the future. That is the central purpose of the chapter. Section 2 examines subsidies in agriculture and transport, as well as policies relating to trade liberalization, privatization, and public infrastructure investment. Section 3 is devoted specifically to energy subsidies. It reviews the results of partial- and general-equilibrium studies on energy subsidies, including environmental impacts (in particular, carbon emissions). Section 4 presents a general-equilibrium model in which energy subsidies and other taxes in the economy are reduced in a revenue-neutral fashion. Two important general-equilibrium effects, the revenue-recycling effect and the tax-interaction effect, are introduced in this section. Sections 5 and 6 continue the discussion of revenue-neutral fiscal policy changes, focusing on the substitution of environmental taxes for other taxes, in particular taxes on labor. This is the "double dividend" debate. Section 5 presents the theory, while Section 6 presents empirical evidence for the European Union. The latter section focuses primarily on employment effects, not welfare effects (the "employment double dividend" vs. "gross welfare dividend"). Section 7 summarizes the main points of the chapter. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Concerns about the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) have prompted proposals to improve its performance by limiting the discretion of decision-makers in screening. To investigate whether such proposals are likely to generate the desired results, we conducted an evaluation of the screening process under the Australian government's EIA regime from its introduction on 16 July 2000 to 30 June 2013 (study period). Almost 1 in 5 'particular manner' decisions-a type of screening decision under the regime-were found to be unlawful. The extent of non-compliance is explained on the basis of convenience. The department was required to assess a large number of projects under tight timeframes and with limited resources, while being pressured by proponents to allow their projects to bypass EIA. These pressures resulted in the development of an informal custom whereby the formal compensatory mitigation restrictions were frequently ignored. The results highlight the relative significance of formal and informal institutions in EIA. Formal EIA rules typically provide a mere outline of the process. The informal institutions adopted by administrators often have a greater influence on how the process operates and what it achieves. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {This paper is concerned with those actions of business firms which have harmful effects on others. The standard example is that of a factory the smoke from which has harmful effects on those occupying neighboring properties. The economic analysis of such a situation has usually proceeded in terms of a divergence between the private and social product of the factory, in which economists have largely followed the treatment of Pigou in The Economics of Welfare. The conclusions to which this kind of analysis seems to have led most economists is that it would be desirable to make the owner of the factory liable for the damage caused to those injured by the smoke, or alternatively, to place a tax on the factory owner varying with the amount of smoke produced and equivalent in money terms to the damage it would cause, or finally, to exclude the factory from residential districts (and presumably from other areas in which the emission of smoke would have harmful effects on others). It is my contention that the suggested courses of action are inappropriate, in that they lead to results which are not necessarily, or even usually, desirable.},

   abstract = {After decades of development, the gap between expectations of Environment Impact Assessments (EIA) and their practical performance remains significant. Research has been done to identify the critical factors for an effective implementation of EIA. However, this research, to a large extent, has not been cumulated and analysed comprehensively according to the stages of the EIA process. This paper contributes to the critical review of the literature on EIA implementation and effectiveness by cumulating mainly empirical findings in an implementation theoretical perspective. It focuses on the links between different critical factors and how they relate to different stages in the EIA and thus influence the decision making process. After reviewing 33 refereed journal articles published between 1999 and 2011, we identified 203 notions of critical factors. Of these, 102 related to different stages defined in our comprehensive EIA implementation model, and 101 were identified as general factors related to the whole EIA system. The number of notions of stage factors and general factors is thus about equal. An overlap between stage factors and general factors was found, which demonstrates that critical factors function differently in different cases. The function of the critical factors is complex and it is difficult to determine contingencies and causations. In the sources we examined, there is evidently an imbalance between in-depth empirical research and general knowledge, and the paper offers some suggestions for future research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The German Excellence Initiative started in 2006 as a public funding program of crucial importance for German universities. Since this time, several studies on different aspects of the program have been conducted, but there have been no analyses using bibliometric methods to measure the direct effects of funding---which is apparently due to the fact that publications resulting from the funding program are not publicly and comprehensively documented. This paper uses the concept of highly cited publications to measure excellent research, and explores two methodological approaches in order to attribute highly cited publications to the Excellence Initiative. To this end, the paper focuses on publications produced by the clusters of excellence (CoEs). The clusters of excellence constitute only one of three funding lines, but receive 60 \{%\} of the total funding of the excellence program and form the core research units of the Excellence Initiative. The highly cited publications of the CoEs are identified via self-selected lists of publications in the CoE renewal proposals and via a funding acknowledgement analysis. The validity of both data sources is analyzed comparatively. Based on the objectives of the Excellence Initiative, its effects on the level of funded clusters, universities and the overall German research system are explored. The bibliometric analysis gives evidence that the funding program has succeeded in concentrating excellent research and fostering collaborations between universities and the non-university research sector, but has not caused massive changes to the overall German research system.},

In the time since, individuals with training in both computing and statistics have become increasingly employable in the burgeoning data science field. In response, universities have developed new courses and programs to meet the growing demand for data science education. To address this demand, we created Data Science in Practice, a large-enrollment undergraduate course. Here, we present our goals for teaching this course, including: (1) conceptualizing data science as creative problem solving, with a focus on project-based learning, (2) prioritizing practical application, teaching and using standardized tools and best practices, and (3) scaling education through coursework that enables hands-on and classroom learning in a large-enrollment course. Throughout this course we also emphasize social context and data ethics to best prepare students for the interdisciplinary and impactful nature of their work. We highlight creative problem solving and strategies for teaching automation-resilient skills, while providing students the opportunity to create a unique data science project that demonstrates their technical and creative capacities.},

Our proposed exercise centers around student use of Google Calendar to collect data with the goal of answering the question “How do I spend my time?” On the one hand, the exercise involves answering a question with near universal appeal, but on the other hand, the data collection mechanism is not beyond the reach of a typical undergraduate student.

To realize this potential, our curricula and educational culture must change.

Computational literacy and programming are as fundamental to statistical practice and research as mathematics. We advocate that our field needs to define statistical computing more broadly to include advancements in modern computing, beyond traditional numerical algorithms. Information technologies are increasingly important and should be added to the curriculum, as should the ability to reason about computational resources, work with large datasets, and perform computationally intensive tasks. We present an approach to teaching these topics in combination with scientific problems and modern statistical methods that focuses on ideas and skills for statistical inquiry and working with data. We outline the broad set of computational topics we might want students to encounter and offer ideas on how to teach them.

These data tend to be nontraditional, in the sense that they are often live, large, complex, and/or messy. A first course in statistics at the undergraduate level typically introduces students to a variety of techniques to analyze small, neat, and clean datasets. However, whether they pursue more formal training in statistics or not, many of these students will end up working with data that are considerably more complex, and will need facility with statistical computing techniques. More importantly, these students require a framework for thinking structurally about data. We describe an undergraduate course in a liberal arts environment that provides students with the tools necessary to apply data science. The course emphasizes modern, practical, and useful skills that cover the full data analysis spectrum, from asking an interesting question to acquiring, managing, manipulating, processing, querying, analyzing, and visualizing data, as well communicating findings in written, graphical, and oral forms.

   abstract = {Data science is an interdisciplinary field that generates insights in data to aid decision-making. Recognizing that data scientists must be interdisciplinary, agile, and able to adapt to data analysis across many domains, both academia and the industry are striving to integrate interdisciplinary learning and transferable skills into data science curriculum. This paper introduces an interdisciplinary approach to teaching the foundations of data science. We evaluate two different interdisciplinary formats. The first format considers collaborative efforts among instructors with different academic disciplines. The second involves a sole instructor that discusses data science concepts from different disciplines and related to business processes, computer science, and programming. We demonstrate that interdisciplinarity ensures favorable learning experiences and produces high learning outcomes. We also show that our course design maintains and promotes interdisciplinarity even in situations where logistical constraints would not support the use of multiple instructors to deliver one course.},

This transformation is also happening in our learning styles and practicing habits. We advocate an approach to data science training that uses several types of computational tools, including R, bash, awk, regular expressions, SQL, and XPath, often used in tandem. We discuss ways for undergraduate mentees to learn about data science topics, at an early point in their training. We give some intuition for researchers, professors, and practitioners about how to effectively embed real-life examples into data science learning environments.

   abstract = {Data science is a discipline that provides principles, methodology, and guidelines for the analysis of data for tools, values, or insights. Driven by a huge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees in data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate level. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying levels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as mathematics, computer science, and business) in developing the curriculum. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from Fall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few articles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much less so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on undergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course in data science. Our design of this course centers around a concept called the data science life cycle. That is, we view tasks or steps in the practice of data science as forming a process, consisting of states that indicate how it comes into life, how different tasks in data science depend on or interact with others until the birth of a data product or a conclusion. Naturally, different pieces of the data science life cycle then form individual parts of the course. Details of each piece are filled up by concepts, techniques, or skills that are popular in industry. Consequently, the design of our course is both “principled” and practical. A significant feature of our course philosophy is that, in line with activity theory, the course is based on the use of tools to transform real data to answer strongly motivated questions related to the data.},

The analysis centers on linguistic patterns of program descriptions, curriculum requirements, and DS course focus as pertaining to key skills and domain knowledge. The results show that a range of unique terms was used in individual program descriptions, with common terms being shared across disciplines. DS programs required varying numbers of credit hours, including practicum and capstone. Most DS courses covered the basic level of analytical skills, but upper-level skills were inadequately addressed. Programs in eight disciplines delivered information skills through their core courses, and four addressed communication skills. Six disciplines covered visualization skills through their core courses, yet just three in elective courses. The course offering on mathematics/statistics was rather weak in iSchools. While core courses in iSchools provided communication and visualization skills, their electives courses did not address such skills. These findings have implications for improving DS education in iSchools and across other disciplines.},

   abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as “cultural appropriation.” This article reviews some ingredients of the current “data science moment,” including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for “scaling up” to “big data.” This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are “learning from data,” and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today’s data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

The visualizations are specifically designed for self-study by students, including a formative self-assessment feature. Students are then assigned a corresponding statistics lesson to utilize statistical software in R within the dplyr framework and to emphasize the need for these database skills.

Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse.

Marine science and technology (S&T) innovation, marine finance, and marine higher education interact and influence each other, and the three have a role in promoting the sustainable development of marine economy. This research analyzed the interaction among marine S&T innovation, marine finance, and marine higher education from the perspective of system coupling and constructed a marine S&T innovation-finance-higher education composite system. Moreover, this research took 11 coastal provinces and cities in China as the research objects, constructed the evaluation index system of marine S&T innovation-finance-higher education composite system, and used the coupling coordination model to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of the coupling coordination level of the marine composite system from 2006 to 2016. Furthermore, this research predicted the coupling coordination level of the marine composite system from 2017 to 2026. The results showed that the degree of interaction among the three subsystems in the marine composite system was strong. The coupling and coordination level of the marine composite system was improved in general, but there were significant differences among provinces and cities. The coordination level of the marine composite system showed an apparent spatial correlation, and the correlation showed an evident trend of enhancement. This study will help relevant departments formulate more effective policies for marine S&T innovation, marine finance, and marine higher education and provide references for decision-making to promote the coordinated development of the three and achieve sustainable development of marine economy.},

T-tests indicated that the interaction between papers and patents was significant. Although there are many paper citations by patents, the distribution of paper citations was more scattered than patent citations by patents. Examining the paper and patent hybrid documents co-citation revealed that papers’ references contained five topics, while patents’ references contained only three.},

   abstract = {Here we present the framework of a new approach to assessing the capacity of research programs to achieve social goals. Research evaluation has made great strides in addressing questions of scientific and economic impacts. It has largely avoided, however, a more important challenge: assessing (prospectively or retrospectively) the impacts of a given research endeavor on the non-scientific, non-economic goals—what we here term “public values”—that often are the core public rationale for the endeavor. Research programs are typically justified in terms of their capacity to achieve public values, and that articulation of public values is pervasive in science policy-making. We outline the elements of a case-based approach to “public value mapping” of science policy, with a particular focus on developing useful criteria and methods for assessing “public value failure,” with an intent to provide an alternative to “market failure” thinking that has been so powerful in science policy-making. So long as research evaluation avoids the problem of public values, science policy decision makers will have little help from social science in making choices among competing paths to desired social outcomes.},

Many studies have addressed this theme with different approaches such as the nature of transversal scientific subjects, the concept of knowledge integration, and the dynamics of research groups to work consistently in collaboration. These are critical factors, particularly to government agencies responsible for assessment and funding researchers, research teams, or graduate courses. In this article, we propose a systemic MIT-D framework to graduate courses and research team's assessment. It takes into account the historical and current research in graduate courses assessment and a national graduate assessment system grounded on peer review and descriptive information conducted by a Brazilian public agency. The framework has three levels of analysis, allowing participation of multiple decision makers, using different approaches to explore four analytical dimensions (individual abilities, collaboration, content, and outputs/outcomes). We have analyzed its applicability in scientometric approaches and research assessment conducted by governmental agencies. The proposed framework is suitable and broadly relevant for both researchers and decision makers for analyzing courses and research teams.},

Due to the constantly changing environment, public governance models have transformed many times, creating differences in public governance practices among public administration institutions, with combinations of contradictory structures and principles that coexist. Accordingly, this paper aims to provide an overview of different public governance models, extract quantifiable elements based on models&rsquo; principles and examine the extent of layering of different governance models at different levels of public administration in the specific case of the Slovenian administration. Thus, the main focus is on identifying the differences in characteristics of public governance practices between state administration and local self-government. The results show state administration institutions are more strongly characterised by the Neo-Weberian model&rsquo;s principles. In contrast, local self-government institutions are more oriented to managerial public governance and Digital-Era Governance practices. Public managers may regard the results as additional resources for democratic and efficient governing. At the same time, they may provide policymakers with in-depth insights to consider while determining the trajectories of future public administration reforms.},

   abstract = {Students' science knowledge and skills are considered critical to growing the intellectual capital on which societies rely to innovate and prosper. However, recent research has documented notable declines in students' intrinsic valuing of science and science achievement in Australia and other western countries. As a result, there have been calls to investigate factors at both the student- and school-level that can improve intrinsic valuing of and achievement in science. Growth feedback from science teachers to students has been identified as one such factor. Growth feedback, which specifically targets individual student growth and improvement, is considered an effective form of teacher feedback. Because recent research has demonstrated the benefits of effective teacher feedback on intrinsic valuing of science and the positive link between intrinsic valuing of science and science achievement, the present investigation examined (at both the student- and school-level) the extent to which growth feedback in science predicts intrinsic valuing of science and the extent to which intrinsic valuing predicts science achievement and mediates the relationship between growth feedback and achievement. This study examined this hypothesized process with the 2015 Australian PISA sample (N = 14,530 students in N = 758 schools) via a multilevel structural equation model. Findings indicated that at both the student- and school-level, growth feedback significantly predicted intrinsic valuing, and intrinsic valuing significantly predicted achievement; growth feedback also had significant indirect effects of achievement via intrinsic valuing. Taken together, our findings indicate that there are personal and whole-school yields for science achievement from the experiences of growth feedback in and intrinsic valuing of science.},

The research method is quantitative, based on panel data regression analysis, correlation between the scholarships abroad granted by the Brazilian public agency Capes, and the evaluation carried out by the institution itself. The period analyzed was from 1998 to 2016, generating a sample of 5,163 observations. Correlation and regression results with panel data show that investment in scholarships abroad has a positive and statistically significant impact on the improvement of postgraduate programs. Furthermore, the results show that investments in scholarships abroad through Capes scholarships are positively correlated with the internationalization of graduate programs in the area of Applied Social Sciences. These results have important implications for policy makers and educational leaders, as they demonstrate the importance of investing in internationalization of higher education to achieve higher levels of excellence.},

   abstract = {Due to developments recently termed as ‘audit,’ ‘evaluation,’ or ‘metric society,’ universities have become subject to ratings and rankings and researchers are evaluated according to standardized quantitative indicators such as their publication output and their personal citation scores. Yet, this development is not only based on the rise of new public management and ideas on ‘the return on public or private investment.’ It has also profited from ongoing technological developments. Due to a massive increase in digital publishing corresponding with the growing availability of related data bibliometric infrastructures for evaluating science are continuously becoming more differentiated and elaborate. They allow for new ways of using bibliometric data through various easily applicable tools. Furthermore, they also produce new quantities of data due to new possibilities in following the digital traces of scientific publications. In this article, I discuss this development as quantification 2.0. The rise of digital infrastructures for publishing, indexing, and managing scientific publications has not only made bibliometric data become a valuable source for performance assessment. It has triggered an unprecedented growth in bibliometric data production turning freely accessible data about scientific work into edited databases and producing competition for its users. The production of bibliometric data has thus become decoupled from their application. Bibliometric data have turned into a self-serving end while their providers are constantly seeking for new tools to make use of them.},

Realizou-se, para tanto, pesquisa bibliográfica. Relatam-se elementos fundantes do programa, bem como desafios enfrentados ao longo dos dez primeiros anos de funcionamento, além de aspectos que se constituíram nas narrativas realizadas nos relatórios postados na Plataforma Sucupira. Verificou-se que o programa, iniciado em 2012, ao longo da primeira década de funcionamento, superou dificuldades relacionadas à matriz curricular e às disciplinas e, também, desenvolveu produtos educacionais de acordo com as diretrizes da área. Percebeu-se que as arestas foram aparadas, nova matriz curricular definida, novo conceito na avaliação quadrienal, possibilitando a submissão e aprovação do curso de Doutorado Profissional.</p>},

Nesse contexto é que este estudo busca avaliar o processo de formação do programa no período de 2012 a 2020 a partir da produção acadêmica e do acompanhamento de egressos. Trata-se de um estudo de natureza documental com vistas a analisar 121 dissertações produzidas nesse período e acompanhar os egressos em termos do impacto da formação e a atuação profissional. Utilizou-se como instrumentos um roteiro de análise e um questionário. Os dados foram tratados por ferramentas disponibilizadas pelo Laboratório de Estatística Aplicada da instituição. Os resultados mostram que 50% das dissertações focam na criação ou uso de recursos didáticos e descreveram/avaliaram estratégias para o ensino de Ciências, principalmente, para o nível médio; 60% dos egressos tiveram melhoria salarial após a conclusão do curso e acreditam que o programa capacita profissionais gerando impactos positivos na sua prática em sala de aula.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Research funders and policymakers increasingly focus on societal benefits of their investments in research. Research institutions thus face increasing pressure to demonstrate their societal impact to prove their legitimacy and worth. To this end, research institutions need reliable, quantitative methods to measure societal impact. This article describes the development and test of an instrument to quantitatively measure societal impact of applied research at research institution and program levels. It demonstrates the successful validation of the instrument in the multi-disciplinary field of occupational health and safety. The instrument, the Societal Impact Instrument: Occupational Health and Safety Research (SII:OHSR), produces an aggregate measure of societal impact for the research institution as a whole and subscales for each research program. The SII:OHSR instrument is built on a process model of knowledge translation and exchange. It has been developed in the context of multi-disciplinary occupational health and safety research. The instrument is constructed as a generalized and context-independent tool that can be relocated to other research domains and languages. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first singular instrument that quantitatively measures societal impact. It is therefore highly pertinent for the research evaluation field.</p>},

   abstract = {How do children affect women in science? We investigate this question using rich biographical data, linked with patents and publications, for 83,000 American scientists in 1956 at the height of the baby boom. Our analyses reveal a unique life-cycle pattern of productivity for mothers. While other scientists peak in their mid-thirties, mothers become more productive after age 35 and maintain high productivity in their 40s and 50s. Event studies show that the output of mothers increases after 15 years of marriage, while other scientists peak in the first 10 years. Differences in the timing of productivity have important implications for tenure and participation. Just 27% of mothers who are academic scientists get tenure, compared with 48% of fathers and 46% of women without children. Mothers face comparable tenure rates to other assistant professors for the first six years but fall behind afterwards, suggesting that they face higher standards of early productivity. Mothers who survive in science are extremely positively selected: Compared with other married women, mothers patent (publish) 2.5 (1.4) times more before the median age at marriage. Compared with men, female scientists are more educated, half as likely to marry, one-third as likely to have children, but half as likely to survive in science. Employment records indicate that a generation of baby boom mothers was lost to science.},

Para a identificação do valor do gasto/aluno procedeu-se à divisão do total dos recursos da Rede pelo número de estudantes matriculados. Para o custo-aluno foi utilizada uma modelagem elaborada por Amaral e Pinto (2005), para a determinação do quantum de recursos aplicados no Ensino, para então dividir pelo total das matrículas. Identificou-se duas tendências, a primeira entre 2009 e 2014, na qual se observou uma elevação dos indicadores e a segunda de 2015 a 2016 de retração, determinada pela crise financeira do Estado em face das disputas pelos recursos do fundo público.</p>},

   abstract = {In August 2018, the president of the World Bank noted that “‘Human capital’—the potential of individuals—is going to be the most important long-term investment any country can make for its people's future prosperity and quality of life”. Nevertheless, leaders and practitioners in academic science and medicine continue to be unaware of and poorly educated about the nature, extent, and impact of barriers to full participation of women and minorities in science and medicine around the world. This lack of awareness and education results in failures to fully mobilise the human capital of half the population and limits global technological and medical advancements. The chronic lack of recruitment, promotion, and retention of women in science and medicine is due to systemic, structural, organisational, institutional, cultural, and societal barriers to equity and inclusion. These barriers must be identified and removed through increased awareness of the challenges combined with evidence-based, data-driven approaches leading to measurable targets and outcomes. In this Review, we discuss these issues and highlight actions that could achieve gender equality in science and medicine. We survey approaches and insights that have helped to identify and remove systemic bias and barriers in science and medicine, and propose tools that will help organisational change toward gender equality. We describe tools that include formal legislation and mandated quotas at national or large-scale levels (eg, gender parity), techniques that increase fairness (eg, gender equity) through facilitated organisational cultural change at institutional levels, and professional development of core competencies at individual levels. This Review is not intended to be an extensive analysis of all the literature currently available on achieving gender equality in academic medicine and science, but rather, a reflection on finding multifactorial solutions.},

We focus on five forms of sexism: (a) stereotypes and discrimination against boys regarding their school behaviors and disciplinary actions; (b) stereotypes and discrimination against girls in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) domains; (c) stereotypes and discrimination in sports; (d) peer gendered harassment, including sexual harassment and teasing because of gender atypicality or nonconformity; and (e) sexualized gender stereotypes that sexually objectify girls and assume boys are sexually voracious. First, we document each type of sexism and examine children's awareness and perceptions of that bias, including their own self-reports and attributions. We examine the implications of this sexism for children and adolescents' developmental health (i.e., social, academic, and psychological well-being). We then draw connections between these various areas of research, focusing on how these different forms of sexism interact to reduce equity and justice among children and negatively impact positive developmental outcomes.

   abstract = {<p>Using data from the Canadian Employer-Employee Dynamics Database between 2001 and 2015, the authors examine the impact of firms’ hiring and pay-setting policies on the gender earnings gap in Canada. Consistent with the existing literature and following Card, Cardoso, and Kline (2016), findings show that firm-specific premiums explain nearly one-quarter of the 26.8% average earnings gap between female and male workers. On average, firms’ hiring practices, due to differences in the relative proportion of women hired at high-wage firms (known as sorting), and pay-setting policies, due to differences in pay by gender within similar firms, each explain approximately one-half of this firm effect. The compositional difference between the two channels varies substantially over a worker’s life cycle, by parental and marital status, and across provinces.</p>},

   abstract = {Gender equality is one of the UN sustainable development goals less discussed in soil science in Indonesia. There is limited information regarding soil science education, and the role of women in Indonesia. This study aimed to provide an overview of the issue of gender equality in Indonesian soil science. We surveyed the number of women soil science students, lecturers, and researchers from 2016 to 2020. Twenty-seven soil science undergraduate programs were identified across government-owned universities in Indonesia. The number of students in soil science is steadily increasing in the last five years, each year with about 1500 new students enroll in soil science. The number of female students also increased with an average proportion of 55% in 2020. However, the number of women academics was only 30%, representing a disproportion of gender equity. The Indonesian soil science society had 35% women members. Students still perceive soil science would be better taught by men lecturers as it involves fieldwork. Nevertheless, more students preferred to be supervised by women lecturers. Our data also revealed that women academics had less opportunity to receive Ph.D. degrees, became professors, and occupied leadership positions in the university. We discuss barriers that hinder women's academics careers in Indonesia, including social and cultural values and organizational barriers. Soil science academics should prepare a gender-equal soil science workforce to the growing population. Thus, supporting the Indonesian soil scientists' women and achieving a more gender balance target is vital for accelerating soil science education, enhancing research opportunities, and managing agriculture to support economic growth.},

   abstract = {O ano de 2006 marca o aniversário de 20 anos da ENAP Escola Nacional de Administração Pública. Uma das iniciativas organizadas para comemorar a ocasião é a publicação de duas coletâneas de textos clássicos e pioneiros sobre áreas-chave para a administração pública brasileira: planejamento, orçamento governamental e políticas públicas. A ENAP, partindo da constatação de que textos clássicos sobre esses temas eram referências utilizadas, e tendo o desafio de formar servidores que possam enfrentar a complexidade da administração pública brasileira, assumiu a tarefa de prover os cursos de formação e de aperfeiçoamento de carreiras com livros didáticos especialmente preparados, em vez de utilizar apenas as tradicionais apostilas. As vantagens são muitas, da oferta de textos inéditos em língua portuguesa até a oportunidade de apresentar ao leitor um espectro variado de autores que trabalham desde os temas básicos até os considerados de ponta. Embora fossem dirigidas inicialmente aos alunos de formação de carreiras – Especialista em Políticas Públicas e Gestão Governamental e Analista de Planejamento e Orçamento % as temáticas tratadas poderão ser utilizadas em outros cursos da ENAP,  como os de aperfeiçoamento, especialização e eventos de capacitação em políticas públicas, planejamento e orçamento. Oferecer a esse público um convite a sua leitura e releitura em forma de coletânea estruturada foi o nosso compromisso. Pela problematização e reflexão que provoca, a leitura dos livros certamente interessará a um público maior, aos técnicos e dirigentes públicos que atuam em planejamento, orçamento, gestão, formulação e implementação de políticas públicas. Instituições públicas federais, estaduais e municipais poderão contar com boa referência para sua atuação, além de professores e pesquisadores. 7Desde 1990, a Escola realizou 23 cursos de formação inicial para as carreiras citadas, além de cursos de especialização e aperfeiçoamento voltados para técnicos que atuam nos programas e projetos governamentais, e tem participado ativamente do processo permanente de capacitação de gerentes de programas e técnicos responsáveis pelas ações do Plano Plurianual (PPA). A ENAP espera cada vez mais atender aos servidores com material didático especialmente preparado aos objetivos dos cursos e às necessidades de desenvolvimento profissional, tendo em vista que a formação deve prepará-los para enfrentar, sob várias perspectivas, os complexos problemas da administração pública brasileira. Esperamos, com essas publicações, contribuir para aumentar o conhecimento e o uso das informações disponíveis sobre os temas tratados, bem como para incentivar o debate e a reflexão crítica sobre os paradigmas fundadores dos campos planejamento, orçamento e políticas públicas.

Por ter se tornado um problema de saúde pública com grande impacto, requer acompanhamento e análises constantes. Objetivo: Mapear e analisar os projetos de pesquisa, de mestrado, doutorado e pós-doutorado, em andamento em 2013 no Brasil e relacionados à dengue, e que possuíam apoio de órgãos de fomento, para criar uma prospecção dos futuros resultados bem como do seu potencial de aplicação para controle da doença, com base nos dados da Plataforma Lattes. Metodologia: Utilizou-se a ferramenta Scriptlattes, com base em arquivos-texto contendo as listas dos pesquisadores, professores e alunos que possuíam o descritor “dengue” em seus currículos, em algum Grupo de Pesquisa em que estivessem cadastrados, ou que tivessem alguma publicação em parceria com os pesquisadores que atendiam as exigências anteriores. Resultados: Notou-se que os estudos relacionados ao aperfeiçoamento dos fármacos para imunização foram os mais frequentes, e em sua maioria destacavam como próximo passo a necessidade da verificação da eficácia de tais fármacos, o que seria uma tendência para os próximos projetos. Conclusão: Os projetos vigentes à época desta experimentação pouco contribuíram para mudar o atual panorama do Brasil em relação à dengue. O olhar prospectivo aqui demonstrado permite a identificação de oportunidades para parcerias entre empresas e centros de pesquisas, além do apoio dos órgãos governamentais de fomento à pesquisa com foco nas principais necessidades do país.},

Identificaram-se os 24 cursos vinculados a instituições de ensino superior públicas e os 383 docentes vinculados a elas. Utilizou-se o software Scriplattes para extração e análise dos dados relacionados à produção de artigos de periódicos, capítulos de livro e livros, a partir de dados disponíveis no currículo da Plataforma Lattes. Foram identificados, ainda, os periódicos, com as respectivas avaliações Qualis, fator de impacto e citescore, nos quais os docentes publicam suas pesquisas. Verificou-se que, no período de 2014 a 2018, foram publicados 2711 artigos em periódicos, 965 capítulos de livro e 130 livros, sendo alguns em colaboração entre os cursos. O periódico em que há maior número de publicações é a Revista CEFAC, a qual possui avaliação B1 no Qualis na área Educação Física (Fonoaudiologia), e não está indexada ao Journal Citation Reports ou a Scopus. Concluiu-se que (1) a produção científica dos docentes fonoaudiólogos é caracterizada principalmente pela publicação de artigos científicos e apresentou uma queda no período analisado; (2) há participação ativa da maioria das regiões do país na produção científica da área; e (3) os periódicos escolhidos pelos docentes para divulgação de seus estudos, em sua maioria, não possuem indexação a bases de dados internacionais e estão no estrato B do Qualis área Educação Física (Fonoaudiologia).Brazilian scientific production is the result of research carried out mainly in the country's university system.

   abstract = {<p>Resumo A produção da ciência tem sido foco de diversas discussões, particularmente no que se refere à produtividade científica. Este artigo tem como objetivo analisar o perfil de pesquisadores doutores que atuam na área de Administração no Brasil e as suas respectivas publicações científicas, de modo a identificar fatores que expliquem esse aspecto da produtividade científica. Utilizando estatística descritiva e modelos estatísticos, com base em dados provenientes de 1976 docentes registrados na Plataforma Lattes, a pesquisa identificou fatores ligados à formação e experiência que influem na produtividade científica dos acadêmicos em Administração. Os resultados da pesquisa também indicam que houve importantes modificações nos padrões de formação acadêmica e de produtividade no país. Considerando a centralidade do tema da produtividade científica, o trabalho sugere novas pesquisas para que se ampliem as discussões sobre os rumos da produção intelectual e da pós-graduação em Administração no Brasil.</p>},

Dados de publicação referentes ao período 2008 a 2012 foram levantados e tabulados dos currículos Lattes dos pesquisadores usando os softwares ScriptLattes e VantagePoint respectivamente. Os 212 títulos de revistas científicas e os 561 artigos identificados dessa fase foram daí pesquisados em outras plataformas como o SciELO, DOAJ, SHERPA/ROMEO, Google Acadêmico e o próprio Repositório Institucional da instituição dos programas de pós-graduação para verificar a proporção de artigos publicados disponível em acesso aberto. Concomitantemente a esses levantamentos quantitativos, foram realizadas entrevistas semiestruturadas com 11 dos pesquisadores dos dois programas para identificar suas percepções em relação à publicação em geral e especificamente em acesso aberto, e em repositórios abertos. Dos dados quantitativos levantados, foi verificado que apenas 25,8% dos artigos publicados do primeiro programa de pós e 23,3% do segundo são disponíveis em acesso aberto. No entanto, nas entrevistas, a maioria dos autores apoia o acesso aberto, embora manifestem pouco conhecimento sobre a via verde, ou os repositórios abertos, incluindo aquele da sua própria instituição, como também desconhecem o caminho complementar de se publicar primeiramente em revistas de alto impacto com o posterior arquivamento do mesmo artigo no repositório, no término do eventual tempo de embargo da editora.},

A pesquisa foi realizada com os docentes que atuam em cursos superiores de tecnologia de um Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia, localizado em Minas Gerais. Os questionamentos que orientaram a investigação foram: Como os docentes têm traçado suas trajetórias e identidades profissionais? Qual importância dada ao Currículo Lattes pelos professores da educação superior pesquisados? Trata-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa, utilizando-se da análise documental. A pesquisa documental foi empreendida aos Currículos Lattes de 45 docentes disponíveis na Plataforma Lattes do CNPQ, sendo 22 do curso na área de Produção Alimentícia, 12 do curso na área de Informação e Comunicação e 11 do curso na área de Gestão e Negócios. Constatamos que a sociedade informacional e a gestão da educação superior no Brasil têm implicado em novos modelos de construção de identidades pelos docentes. Observamos três grupos de identidades constituídas pelos sujeitos da pesquisa sendo: a identidade dos que ficam à margem da produtividade exigida na educação superior, sendo esta a representação de um grupo pequeno que demonstra não aderência às exigências do atual sistema de produção acadêmica; o segundo grupo, numericamente mais representativo, é formado pelos docentes que aderiram de forma ainda tímida, mas que já demonstram envolvimento nas exigências de produtividade acadêmica e, por fim, o terceiro grupo, pequeno, está imerso no esquema de alta produtividade e visível intensificação do trabalho, principalmente, por ser constituído por docentes que atuam majoritariamente na pós-graduação stricto sensu. Cada grupo vive os dilemas próprios de sua condição identitária que não se apresenta fixa e imutável, mas em evidente processo de construção.},

Os dados foram organizados em termos das universidades de formação e de atuação dos(as) pesquisadores(as) por períodos temporais. O panorama construído converge com um aspecto histórico marcante no desenvolvimento da pós-graduação brasileira: a concentração da formação em mestrado e doutorado e da atuação de pesquisadores(as) em PPGs da região sudeste. A Universidade de São Paulo (USP) e a Pontifícia Universidade Católica de São Paulo (PUC-SP) formaram 45% dos 169 docentes. Os/as pesquisadores(as) que mais orientaram os(as) docentes da pesquisa tiveram participação ativa na construção da psicologia social crítica brasileira.

Based on this mapping, we present an overview of the universities that provide master’s and doctorate studies and of the work of these researchers, articulating it with some considerations on the construction and consolidation of PPGs in Brazil. We selected 169 researchers from 37 different PPGs situated in all five regions of the country: The data were organized according to academic formation and work universities of the researchers per period. The built panorama converges with a notable historical aspect in the development of Brazilian graduation: concentration in the Southeast region. USP and PUC-SP constituted 45% of the 169 professors. The researchers who most oriented the professors of the research had active participation in the construction of Brazilian critical social psychology. The results show the importance of conducting new research on: a) the impact of the operational displacement of researchers trained in the Southeast to other regions; b) the consequences of changes in the evaluation of the regional asymmetries proposed in the VI Planos Nacionais de Pós-graduação (PNPG); c) the consequences of the Federal Government’s limitation of expenditures on regional inequality related to scientific investment in graduate studies.Resumen Este artículo se remite a los resultados de una investigación iniciada en 2014, que objetivó construir un mapeamiento de investigadores/as de Programas de Postgrado (PPG) brasileños en psicología social y en psicología que identificaban la psicología social como el área de actuación en el currículo Lattes y presentaban publicaciones científicas sobre temas políticos.

To have an idea of this index among Brazilian scientists, we performed an analysis of this parameter for the full members of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (BAS). The h-index of 402 members listed in 10 distinct categories by the BAS was determined, cross-checked with the curriculum vitae of each of them listed at the Plataforma Lattes database (CVL) and compared with each other. Despite the large production, mostly in journals without impact factor, the h-indexes among the BAS members are comparatively low and show a large variation in all of the 10 categories, particularly in Biomedical and Physical sciences. The highest average of h-index values was found in Biomedical, Health and Chemical sciences; the lowest values were found in Human sciences where this index is meaningless. Several problems due to the trend that new and "fresh" publications need be constantly produced (the "bakery-effect") are discussed. This study points to the need of developing countries such as Brazil to invest in national scientific journals in order to make them gradually part of the mainstream journals. This would have a positive effect on bibliometric parameters of Brazilian researchers, including the h-index.},

Aiming to contribute to the understanding of scientific collaboration initiatives, the present research's objective was to investigate the relationship between outside teacher education, represented by the completion of a doctoral degree and post-doctoral internship, and international collaboration, identified by the international co-authorships in institutional scientific output. The research method was the exploratory case study, and the case unit was the Federal University of São Carlos. The Lattes Platform and the Web of Science were used as sources of information, and the sample analyzed comprised 12,787 scientific articles and 1,915 Lattes resumés. It was found that 1,850 teachers have doctoral or post-doctoral education (96.6%) and, of these, 632 graduated abroad (33.1%). Regarding the scientific output, 3,487 of the 12,787 articles were published in international co-authorship (27.3%). From the scientific output in international co-authorship, indicators on the groups of teachers with and without education abroad were analyzed. Among the indicators developed, 8.43 articles per teacher were identified for the group with education abroad, while in the group without education abroad, 4.26 articles were identified per teacher. The results demonstrate a positive relationship between doctoral or post-doctoral education abroad with international co-authorships, contributing to institutional internationalization.},

A colaboração científica pode contemplar diversos níveis de análise, dando ênfase nos aspectos internos – intrainstitucional, (intra)nacional – ou em situar o que está sendo analisado em um contexto externo – interinstitucional, internacional e outros. No entanto, a questão da colaboração intraorganizacional e identificação de possíveis colaborações têm pouca abordagem e estudos. Não há conhecimento de estudos que tratem simultaneamente desses dois temas visando à identificação de oportunidades de colaboração interna em uma instituição. Assim, este trabalho apresenta um panorama da colaboração científica entre os docentes de uma universidade federal do estado de São Paulo, e expõe um procedimento para identificar pesquisadores potenciais para futuras colaborações. A identificação dessas colaborações em potencial baseia-se no acoplamento de autores por temáticas através das palavras-chave lançadas pelos próprios docentes em seus Currículos Lattes. Foram identificados 635 docentes e 2.678 palavras. E, como resultado, é apresentada uma rede de afiliação por palavras-chave, onde é possível identificar os pesquisadores com alto potencial de colaboração, o que pode auxiliar os próprios docentes a identificarem seus possíveis parceiros, além de poder ser utilizada por órgãos institucionais estratégicos para fomentar a colaboração entre os professores internos à organização. },

   abstract = {Objective To characterize researchers in the Nutrition field awarded with Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico research productivity fellowships and evaluate their scientific production according to an analysis of curricula registered on the Lattes Platform. Methods The study is cross-sectional and descriptive in scope, and was developed from October 2014 to February 2015. The productivity fellowships/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico researchers were identified from the Lattes Platform, and their curriculum lattes were downloaded for data collation. Information on the profiles of the researchers and the bibliometric data of productivity (published articles, articles and citations registered on ISI/Web of Science and Scopus databases, impact of the publications, and academic advising) were collected. Results Eighty researchers were identified and evaluated. A total of 67.5% were female and 53.5% were classified as category 2. Approximately two-thirds (65.0%) were located in Southeastern Brazil. The sum of articles published by the researchers from the beginning of their career until the end of the study came to 7,358 (median=84 per researcher, interquartile range=53-285). Of these publications, 45.0% were indexed in the Web of Science and 62.0% in Scopus. Of the journals where the articles were published, 70.0% had an impact factor. Conclusion Most publications were performed in journals with an impact factor, indicating the influence of Brazilian nutrition studies on society and their potential for guiding public policies on nutrition and health.},

   abstract = {In Brazil, meiofauna studies began in the middle of last century, but they adopted a purely taxonomical approach, describing species from various zoological groups. After this first step, this benthic group was largely neglected until the end of the 20th century when ecological studies began. We here provide a brief review of present knowledge of the meiofauna found on Brazilian sandy beaches to provide information for ReBentos (Coastal Benthic Habitats Monitoring Network). Our methodology consisted of a bibliographic survey undertaken using different datasets (Web of ScienceTM, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Lattes Plataform). For the survey, we considered only those studies published till early 2015. Our analysis showed that the number of meiofauna studies has increased over the last two decades, though they are mainly still concentrated on the Southeast of Brazil. These studies aim to explain the distribution pattern of the meiofauna of the intertidal region of sandy beaches. Based on the results, we presented a discussion of three main topics, i.e., (a) current knowledge of Brazilian sandy beach meiofauna, (b) sampling strategies for monitoring of the meiofauna, and (c) use of the meiofauna as a tool to assess climate change. We trust that this brief review will be useful as a starting point for the delineation of further climate change investigations into sandy beach meiofauna.},

Na busca de almejar uma possível resposta para essa questão emblemática, o estudo trabalhou em uma amostra de 978 pesquisadores que possuíam estágio pós-doutoral realizado no exterior, analisando egressos do programa na Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Capes, verificando a sua produção técnica e de extensão universitária em um cenário ex ante e ex post ao contexto pós-doutoral. Sob a ótica da produção de uma forma mais ampla, os dados apontam para um cenário drástico de impacto nulo para praticamente 11% da amostra, além disso, registra um impacto leve ou baixo de uma forma geral, mas os dados apontam para exceções que merecem ser consideradas, na busca de se fomentar um cenário mais amplo que vá além das atividades de pesquisa e que considerem o sistema de pós-graduação de uma forma mais sistêmica e integrada a tríade ensino-pesquisa-extensão.},

Objective: To outline the profile of Brazilian physiotherapist researchers, permanent, or collaborator professors of PhD programs in physiotherapy. Methods: Study of documentary analysis with scientometric techniques on physiotherapist data in Brazilian doctors associated professors in PhD programs. To identify the professors, the Sucupira and Lattes Platforms were used, and the research areas were categorized according to COFFITO. Data on the research area, the number of orientations, publications and impact factor average (JCR) were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA test (p < 0.05), and a collaboration network was built using Gephi 0.9.1 software. Results: Nine institutions of higher education in Brazil have a PhD in physiotherapy. A total of 119 professors are associated with UFMG (20.2%), UFSCAR (17.6%), UFRN (13.4%), and UNINOVE (10.9%). The median number of doctors graduated by the professors was 1.0 (0.0 - 6.0) and in publications in the period was 4.6 (2.4 - 8.4). The main study designs were observational 71 (59.7%), and the main research area was neurofunctional 25 (21.0%). The collaboration between UFSCAR and UFMG professors is strengthened. Conclusion: There are few specific doctoral programs for physiotherapists in Brazil. The majority of them are concentrated in the southeast region, and the professor staff have very heterogeneous characteristics related to the duration of the programs, the nature of the institution, or the affiliation of the professor.Resumo Introdução: Conhecer o perfil dos cientistas brasileiros é importante para compreender fatores que influenciam os comportamentos dos interessados em desenvolver ciência.

Neste estudo, a elite foi definida como o grupo de 1.205 pesquisadores que recebiam bolsa de produtividade PQ 1A do CNPq em 2016. Foram coletados, na Plataforma Lattes, dados pessoais e acadêmicos e dados sobre a produção científica desses pesquisadores referentes ao período de 2000 a 2015, em quadriênios. Definiu-se adesão como a fração de artigos em acesso aberto de cada um dos 1.205 pesquisadores PQ 1A em relação ao total de artigos que eles publicaram. Foram realizadas três análises, buscando identificar a relação da adesão aos periódicos de acesso aberto com: (1) o gênero dos pesquisadores, (2) a região geográfica da instituição de vínculo e (3) a grande área de pesquisa definida pelo CNPq. Verificou-se, ao longo dos quadriênios, uma redução na faixa de pesquisadores classificados como de muito baixa adesão ao acesso aberto, porém, somente 10% dos pesquisadores foram classificados como de alta ou muito alta adesão. Pesquisadoras mulheres, pesquisadores da região Nordeste e pesquisadores das ciências agrárias e das ciências sociais aplicadas mostraram maior adesão aos periódicos de acesso aberto. O conjunto de resultados indica que a adesão a periódicos de acesso aberto pela elite brasileira de pesquisadores, apesar de crescente, ainda é baixa, um cenário preocupante, dado que esse grupo é referência para a comunidade científica brasileira.},

O trabalho foi desenvolvido mediante pesquisa documental, censitária, exploratória e descritiva, na qual a unidade de análise é composta pelos estudantes egressos do POLEDUC, pertencentes às turmas de 2007 a 2014. O levantamento dos dados profissionais e acadêmicos dos Lattes dos egressos foi realizado em junho de 2016, totalizando 146 egressos, excluindo-se os cancelamentos e desistências. O levantamento realizado indicou prevalência de mulheres e servidores da área administrativa das instituições de ensino superior. Verificou-se também que apenas metade dos estudantes publicou algum artigo durante curso, e apenas um terço publicou após o mestrado. Em relação aos aspectos de continuidade na carreira, poucos egressos ingressaram em programas de doutorado e, entre os técnicos, cerca de 14% exerceram alguma atividade docente após o mestrado. Os resultados indicam que a maioria dos egressos do POLEDUC não apresenta continuidade na carreira na perspectiva acadêmica.},

Still, one element is scarcely considered: the issue of gender equality in the discipline. This article seeks to identify gender differences in the academic trajectories of scholars in two countries: Brazil and Uruguay. The focus is on the degree of internationalization of their academic careers. Internationalization is measured in two dimensions: academic training abroad and publication of articles in foreign journals. The analysis relies on primary data collected from the curriculum vitae (CV) published by the national research system of each country: Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq - Lattes) (Brazil) and Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación (ANII-SNI) (Uruguay). The evidence suggests that in both cases women are underrepresented in the universe and publish fewer articles (both in national and foreign journals) than their male counterparts. However, the data show that there are no gender differences in access to training and publication opportunities abroad, nor in the countries of destination.},

The initial data source was the Human Resources Directory (Diretoria de Recursos Humanos - Direh) at Fiocruz, which was used to identify the number of employees with doctorates. The ScriptLattes tool was then used to search for curriculum vitae (CV) that were registered in the Lattes Platform for the period from 1996 to 2013. The results indicate that although women’s bibliographic production in absolute numbers is greater than men's, they have an average production performance higher than women’s. A second document analysis was performed to map women's participation in decision-making positions at Fiocruz. In general, the data suggest hierarchical (or vertical) segregation, a phenomenon known in the literature as the “glass ceiling”, which is characterized by a slower rise in career for women compared to men. This disadvantage results in the underrepresentation of women in positions of decision-making, and women are limited from reaching the most prestigious positions in the institution.},

A partir de informações obtidas na Plataforma Lattes, do CNPq, e em sites institucionais, realizamos um mapeamento das docentes universitárias afro-brasileiras e africanas dos países africanos de língua oficial portuguesa (PALOP) que pesquisam sobre tecnologias digitais e são vinculadas aos cursos de Ciências da Computação, Comunicação, Pedagogia e Ciências Sociais de universidades públicas, no período compreendido entre 1989 e 2019. Por meio de uma abordagem interseccional, analisamos como o fenômeno da brecha digital posiciona as mulheres negras no campo da pesquisa sobre tecnologias digitais e concluímos que, apesar de ser identificada a presença de docentes negras nas universidades desenvolvendo pesquisas sobre tecnologias digitais, sua participação nesta área ainda é incipiente. No que se refere aos PALOP, as informações disponíveis na internet foram insuficientes para que pudéssemos reunir elementos que garantam uma análise segura do fenômeno nas universidades públicas investigadas.},

The analysis of the answers by scientific area and gender was made using the chi-square test. Significant differences were found between men and women from the different scientific areas regarding the career interest phase, in adulthood for women and childhood for men. Gender differences were related to the characteristics of persistence and nonconformity, which was more valued by women for a scientific career. The results suggest that gender and the area of knowledge influence personal variables more than contextual variables in scientific excellence.},

The method used was the correlation matrix, using as research source the data collected from PPGMADE and Plataforma Lattes, from CNPq (Brazilian National Research Council). It is assumed that the majority of the doctors trained by the PPGMADE have a teaching role, which allows them to expand their research within the academic environment, redistributing knowledge and opportunities to their students. It was found that a large portion of the PPGMADE doctors continue to work in their research areas, with 84.33% acting as university professors, leaders and participants of research groups, extension project leaders working with communities, opinion formers, and also contine to publish their research in scientific journals, events, media, chapters of books and books.

E foi nesse ponto que buscamos alcançar, em uma conversa em que a professora contasse sua história de vida e como as questões da Educação Profissional perpassaram e ainda perpassam sua história no seu processo de formação profissional, nos ambientes acadêmico e institucional.No decorrer de sua narrativa, percebemos a grandeza dessa mulher, trabalhadora, filha de operários, que identifica claramente as marcas históricas, tanto familiares quanto sociais, como constituintes de sua pessoa. Com essa identificação ela nos ensina conceitos fundamentais para se pensar uma outra escola, uma outra sociedade...E nos devolve a esperança, não a esperança ingênua, mas a esperança da luta e da certeza de que estamos do lado certo da história!},

Method: a methodological study, of appearance and content validation, developed in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil, in 2018. The data were collected by sending the evaluation instruments via e-mail to selected specialists on the Lattes Platform. In the analysis, the Content Validity Index was used with an established value of 0.78. Results: 15 specialists participated, with experience in educational technologies and/or violence against women, most of them have doctorates and nursing degrees. Regarding structure and presentation, objectives and relevance, all items were considered validated by experts. The global Content Validity Index of the educational technology was 0.93. Conclusion: The serial album has been validated for content and appearance, suggesting that this educational technology enables health education actions performed by nurses of Basic Care.},

   abstract = {This article performs an analysis of female participation in science, in the Brazilian system of graduate studies and scientific research as a case study. This is relevant because science is a central supporting structure for modern societies and, therefore, a detailed analysis of the scientific power structure behind academic policy creation can reveal aspects of androcentrism in scientific activity. The main goal of this work is to identify the process of misogyny in science by describing its reproductive pattern. Our results show that women are around 50% of the undergraduate and graduate students when all fields are taken into consideration, but only 37% of the researchers in the CNPq system. We also observe a significant increase in female percentage within scientific activities at the initial and intermediary levels, except for the most prestigious areas as hard science. However, a scissor effect is identified between the initial level and the more prominent positions. This unbalanced participation reveals that female occupations in science are mostly as lower workforce since women are quite far from the social decision-making circles in this career},

In this work, we quantify gender diversity in Brazilian academia using three types of indicators: production of knowledge, temporal evolution in the career, and training of human resources to study in detail the profile of the Deans of Research and Graduate Studies in 215 Higher Education Institutions in the year of 2019. Our analysis shows that around only 36% of positions were occupied by women, a percentage that is not consistent with the number of women professors in Brazilian higher education. Using the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) Lattes' Platform databank, we show that men and women in dean positions publish roughly the same number of paper/scientific articles per year and present almost the same time elapsed in the career path, while women produce more human resources. The fact that women occupy only 1/3 of the positions of dean of research and graduation reveals that for women to reach the top, it is necessary that they adapt to the same metric intended for men while facing additional challenges indicating a persistent glass ceiling.

Numerous authors point out that among the factors of extreme relevance to this fact, the main is the increased presence of women in the formal job market. Researches also reveal that the increase in quantity is not reflected equally in all productive sectors nor the egalitarian occupation of high hierarchical positions. The present study aimed to analyze how the presence of women, especially in leadership positions, has evolved at the Brazilian Federal Agency for the Support and Evaluation of Postgraduate Education (CAPES) and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) over the last 20 years. For these analyzes, surveys were conducted in the people management systems of the Brazilian Federal Public Administration. The initial hypothesis was that female attendance had increased in both the total number of female servants and in management and auxiliary positions, known as DAS in Brazil; however, evidence shows that women reduced overall agency presence, especially in the number of female Analysts occupying DAS positions. These results indicate that the misogyny observed in the academic sphere of the Brazilian National Postgraduate and Science, Technology, and Innovation systems are replicated in the politic-bureaucratic sphere that manages and sponsors these systems.},

Moreover, the staff has higher percentage of moral harassment victims. We also unvealed an important problem of under-notification, where only around 10% of these cases are reported.

Sob esta perspectiva, a vida de Emmy Nöther levanta a questão sobre a situação atual da atuação da mulher em ciência. Esse aspecto é abordado através de uma análise da participação de mulheres atuando em ciências com dados do CNPq e da CAPES. Para discutir e apresentar a dimensão apropriada dos resultados principais de Emmy Nöther, contextualizando a importância na física contemporânea, um caminho algébrico é seguido (nos livros textos, os teoremas são apresentados através do formalismo Lagrangiano), mas tanto quanto possível procurando uma abordagem discurso pedagógica.Abstract The Nöther's theorem is revisited with two main goals: to reinforce the meaning of such results for the contemporary physics and to present aspects of the Nöther's biography emphasizing the misogyny process that she suffered during her scientific life, despite of the recognized importance of her results even when she was alive. Under this perspective, the Nöther's live raises questions about the present-day participation of women in science. This aspect is addressed by an analysis of female researchers, by using data from CNPq and CAPES (two Brazilian Government agencies).

Para tanto, foram aplicados questionários com seis perguntas semiestruturadas abertas e fechadas envolvendo tais temáticas. Como principal resultado, observou-se que os fatores sociais ligados à cultura, podem exercer um peso maior na formação do pensamento dessas crianças sobre a atuação de homens e mulheres na ciência, o que acaba repercutindo em suas escolhas para a vida adulta.

Abstract: This article presents the results of a study carried out with 66 students from the early years of elementary school aged between 06 and 12 years old about gender, work and science, in order to identify elements related to stereotypes in their responses. Therefore, questionnaires with six semi-structured open and closed questions involving such themes were applied. As a main result, it was observed that social factors linked to culture may exert a greater weight in the formation of these children's thoughts about the role of men and women in science, which ends up affecting their choices for adult life. INTRODUÇÃO As diferenças entre o interesse de meninos e meninas pela ciência é algo que vem sendo discutido nos últimos anos e merece atenção. Pesquisas apontam que, desde cedo, as meninas não têm interesse pela ciência e não pretendem ser cientistas. Um estudo realizado com 1.034 estudantes de ensino médio de 20 escolas espalhadas por cinco regiões brasileiras evidenciou que de 100% dos meninos entrevistados, 26,9% gostariam de ser cientistas, ao passo que apenas 18,6% das meninas têm esse interesse. (CUNHA; PERES; GIORDAN; BERTOLDO; MARQUES; DUNCKE, 2014) Na escola foi identificado que as meninas até os 12 anos de idade, em geral, têm facilidade com cálculos, mas com o passar do tempo essa facilidade dá lugar a dificuldade confirmada através das notas baixas em matemática. Sugere-se que os fatores que influenciam esse desempenho estejam ligados ao estereótipo. (CUNHA, et al. 2014) 1},

   abstract = {Introduction: The worldwide sustained growth of health spending leads us to study the efficient resources allocation of the health sector. In this context, economic evaluations constitute a valuable tool for decision making. In order to do so, it is necessary to estimate the costs of the evaluated alternatives. Cost studies include disease costs estimations which identify, quantify and evaluate all the economic resources involved in a health-disease-care process decision. Objective: Describe how the different perspectives of analysis can modify the cost estimations of the same health condition. Materials and methods: Descriptive study based on a non-systematic review of the literature about the analysis’ perspective of the studies regarding the costs of the diseases during the period 1960-2015. Results: It is observed that, in most cases, the cost estimates consider the direct health costs derived from the benefits of the prevention and treatment of diseases. The perspective of the patient and his/her family presents an exception. From this perspective direct nonhealth costs are not usually included in the economic valuations of a disease. Indirect and intangible costs are only indirectly taken into account from the perspective of the professional, the state or the third-party payer, when decisions are made based on cost-utility studies that underlie the quality of life of patients. Discussion: Not recognizing all the costs involved in a disease may underestimate the economic impact of the disease leading to incorrect health policies, inefficient allocation of resources and partial assessments of the costs associated with available treatments or alternatives, which could bias the results obtained in cost-effectiveness studies used to guide medical practice and benefit coverage.},

The analysis covered the years 1995 to 2016 and used econometric techniques in panel data. According to the findings, educational factors (thesis supervision), economic factors (technological products and the rovision of technological services), and political factors (legal framework, financial resources, and incentive policies) impact the production of patent applications by the selected researchers.

In the control of the ecological process and for environmental management, it is necessary to quickly and accurately identify surface water contamination (in areas such as rivers and dams) with contaminated runoff waters coming, for example, from cultivation and urban areas. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms applied to the data collected from a sample of soil-contaminated water aiming to identify if the water quality classification proposed in this research agrees with reality. The sample was part of a laboratory experiment, which began with a sample of treated water added with increasing fractions of soil. The results show that the proposed classification for water quality in this scenario is coherent, because different algorithms indicated a strong statistic relationship between the classes and their instances, that is, in the classes that qualify the water sample and the values which describe each class. The proposed water classification varies from excelling to very awful (12 classes).},

Among these models, the Decision Tree (DT) technique has been increasingly applied due to its capacity of dealing with large datasets. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the data volume used to generate the DT models on the quality of soil maps. An area of 889.33 km² was chosen in the Northern region of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The soil-landscape relationship was obtained from reambulation of the studied area and the alignment of the units in the 1:50,000 scale topographic mapping. Six predictive covariates linked to the factors soil formation, relief and organisms, together with data sets of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 % of the total data volume, were used to generate the predictive DT models in the data mining program Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). In this study, sample densities below 5 % resulted in models with lower power of capturing the complexity of the spatial distribution of the soil in the study area. The relation between the data volume to be handled and the predictive capacity of the models was best for samples between 5 and 15 %. For the models based on these sample densities, the collected field data indicated an accuracy of predictive mapping close to 70 %. Index terms: decision tree, pedometry, soil survey, mapping unit. Informações digitais tornam possível um elevado grau de redundância das informações disponíveis para o ajuste de modelos preditores aplicados ao Mapeamento Digital de Solos (MDS).

Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar o impacto do volume de dados utilizados para gerar os modelos por AD, na qualidade dos mapas de solos gerados pela técnica de MDS. Uma área de estudo com 889,33 km² foi escolhida na região do Planalto Médio do Rio Grande do Sul. As relações solo-paisagem foram obtidas a partir de reambulação da área de estudo e delineamento das unidades de mapeamento em cartas topográficas de escala 1:50.000. Seis covariáveis preditoras ligadas aos fatores de formação do solo, relevo e organismos, juntamente com os conjuntos de dados de um, três, cinco, 10, 15, 20 e 25 % do volume total de dados, foram usadas para gerar os modelos preditivos por AD no programa WEKA. Neste estudo, densidades de amostragem menores do que 5 % resultaram em modelos com menor poder de capturar a complexidade da distribuição espacial do solo da área estudada. Amostragens entre cinco e 15 % conduziram a uma melhor relação entre o volume de dados a ser manipulado e a capacidade preditiva dos modelos gerados. Dados coletados no campo indicaram acurácia dos mapas preditos próxima a 70 %, para os modelos oriundos dessas densidades de amostragem.

   abstract = {RESUMO Os princípios FAIR, um acrônimo para Findable, Accessible, Interoperable e Reusable, estão presentes nas discussões e práticas contemporâneas da ciência de dados, desde o início de 2014, e tiveram sua aplicação consolidada em 2017, quando a Comissão Europeia passou a exigira adoção de plano de gestão de dados, com base nesses princípios, por projetos financiados por seus recursos. Desde então, tais princípios passaram a ser norteadores da descoberta, do acesso, da interoperabilidade, do compartilhamento e da reutilização dos dados de pesquisa. No entanto, quando colocados em prática levantam dúvidas e imprecisões, gerando diferentes interpretações, o que dificulta sua aplicação. Por essa razão buscou-se elucidar seu entendimento, utilizando-se de conceitos esclarecedores, apresentando métricas específicas que medem o nível de FAIRness dos objetos digitais; disseminando a proposta do ecossistema dos dados FAIR e as tecnologias Data FAIRPort e FAIR Data Point. Apresentamos, ainda, estudos realizados na Europa que comprovam o impacto e o potencial desses princípios, em diferentes áreas disciplinares, dando destaque às necessidades e aos exemplos de aplicação. A abordagem metodológica desta pesquisa é de natureza bibliográfica e de caráter qualitativo dando ênfase na descrição conceitual dos elementos necessários para a compreensão do ecossistema FAIR, o que permitiu, neste estudo, trabalhar a fundamentação teórica e conceitual, bem como o uso das práticas do FAIR em diferentes contextos e dimensões. As considerações finais corroboram as mudanças culturais e tecnológicas que vêm ocorrendo, no mundo informacional, relacionadas às novas práticas de gestão de dados e às interações e parcerias necessárias para a sua complexa implementação. ABSTRACT The FAIR Principles, an acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable, has beenpresent in the contemporary discussions and practices of data science since the beginning of 2014 and had its application consolidated in 2017, when the European Commission began to demand the adoption of data management plans, based on these principles, by projects funded by its resources. Since then, these principles have been guiding the discovery, access, interoperability, sharing and reuse of research data. However, when it is put into practice it raises doubts and inaccuracies, leading to different interpretations, which hinders its application.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the scientific production of researchers in Hematology/Oncology who hold scientific productivity grants from the Brazilian Council for Scientific and Technological Development. Methods: the Academic CVs of 28 researchers in Hematology/Oncology with active grants in the three-year period from 2006 to 2008 were included in the analysis. The variables of interest were: institution, researchers' time after doctorate, tutoring of undergraduate students, masters and PhD degree, scientific production and its impact. Results: from a total of 411 researchers in Medicine, 28 (7%) were identified as being in the area of Hematology/Oncology. There was a slight predominance of males (53.6%) and grant holders in category 1. Three Brazilian states are responsible for approximately 90% of the researchers: São Paulo (21,75%), Rio de Janeiro (3,11%), and Minas Gerais (2, 7%). During their academic careers, the researchers published 2,655 articles, with a median of 87 articles per researcher (IQR = 52 to 122). 65 and 78% of this total were indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus databases, respectively. The researchers received 14,247 citations on the WoS database with a median of 385 citations per researcher. The average number of citations per article was 8.2. Conclusion: in this investigation, it was noted that researchers in the field of Hematology/ Oncology have a relevant scientific output from the point of view of quantity and quality compared to other medical specialties.},

Verificou-se que, em média, os pesquisadores que interagem com o setor privado são mais produtivos do que aqueles que não realizam a cooperação, em concordância com a literatura internacional. Entretanto, os resultados encontrados sugerem que a interação U-E pode não apresentar impacto positivo ou até mesmo ter efeito negativo sobre o número de artigos publicados, segundo a estimação de efeitos fixos. Por outro lado, não há evidências de que a interação U-E afeta a produtividade mensurada pelo fator de impacto (IFPA) dos artigos publicados. O pico produtivo para os pesquisadores constantes na amostra situa-se em torno dos 30 anos após a conclusão do doutorado.

Abstract: Based on bibliographic parameters, this article analyzed the current scenario of "gymnastics" in academic-scientific research published in Brazilian journals indexed in the area of Physical Education by Capes in 2000-2015. We found 340 articles on 61 journals, mainly from Southeastern Brazil, with a peak in publication on the subject in 2010. Furthermore, Brazilian production is conveyed in journals from strata B4, B1 and B2, and none of them continuously published studies about gymnastics during the period. It is possible to confirm that the increase in publications coincided with the organization and consolidation of events in the area. A decrease in production after 2010 can be explained by the attempt to internationalize research and high interest in publishing in journals of higher impact factor. Palavras-chave Bibliometria.

Para atingir os objetivos, apresentam-se três procedimentos e um novo indicador científico. Os procedimentos aprimoraram a avaliação sobre as contribuições do Programa para a nucleação e sobre o perfil da formação dos egressos. O outro procedimento está relacionado à gestão, que identifica os efeitos da avaliação da CAPES pelas medidas corretivas. O indicador de coautoria discente/docente aponta a inviabilidade das Portarias dos 8, pois o número de discentes por docente não afeta a produção científica por discente. Os procedimentos e o indicador de coautoria podem ser utilizados como parâmetros adicionais à avaliação da CAPES, contribuindo no aprimoramento da Avaliação Institucional dos Programas.},

   abstract = {In recent decades, we have observed an intensification of science, technology and innovation activities in Brazil. The increase in production of scientific papers indexed in international databases, however, has not been accompanied by an equivalent increase in the impact of publications. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing production and the impact of certain research areas in Brazil related to two aspects: the origin of the journals (national or foreign) and international collaboration. These two variables were selected for being of particular importance in understanding the context of scientific production and communication in countries with emerging economies. The sample consisted of papers written by Brazilian researchers in 19 subfields of knowledge published from 2002 to 2011, totaling 85,082 papers. To calculate the impact, we adopted a normalized indicator called the relative subfield citedness (Rw) using a window of 5 years to obtain measurements evaluated in 2 different years: 2007 and 2012. The data on papers and citations were collected from the Web of Science database. From the results, we note that most of the subfields have presented, from one quinquennium to another, improved performance in the world production rankings. Regarding publication in national and foreign journals, we observed a trend in the distribution maintenance of production of the subfields based on the origin of the journal. Specifically, for impact, we identified a lower Rw pattern for Brazilian papers when they were published in national journals in all subfields. When Brazilian products are published in foreign journals, we observed a higher impact for those papers, even surpassing the average global impact in some subfields. For international collaboration, we analyzed the percentage of participation of foreign researchers and the connection between collaboration and the impact of papers, especially emphasizing the distinction of hyperauthorship papers in terms of production and impact.},

Foram recuperados 798 artigos sobre nanotecnologia e saúde. Destes, somente 41 referem-se a temas relacionados a questões do meio ambiente, de saúde e segurança, mostrando o baixo volume de pesquisas nessa área no país. Foram utilizadas técnicas bibliométricas, com software de mineração de dados para a filtragem e análise dos resultados. A produção científica nacional sobre o assunto mostrou-se pulverizada em diversos periódicos. O surgimento de novas temáticas, nos últimos anos, pode representar um desejável indicador de crescente interesse por questões regulatórias e sociais no país.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the scientific output and collaboration of Brazilian agricultural research in the Web of Science (WoS) during 2000-2011. A total of 45,163 documents were retrieved. Data analysis was conducted with the use of the softwares Bibexcel and Pajek. The results indicated that the number of Brazilian articles in the field of agricultural sciences indexed in WoS has increased by 344%; however, the main driver for this growth was the raise in the number of national journals indexed in the database. Although Brazilian articles have been found in 799 journals from 46 countries, 53.5% of the total production was published in national journals with low impact factor. The percentage of articles with multiple authors in the total volume of publications increased from 96.1% in 2000 to 98.4% in 2011. The proportion of articles in collaboration between institutions rose from 47.3%, in 2000, to 64.2%, in 2011. However, there was a decrease in publications with international collaboration from 21.7 % in 2000 to 15.4 % in 2011. The most important collaborative relationships were established with the U.S., France and Germany.},

   abstract = {This article aimed to evaluate the influence of the alignment of operators' preferences for aggregating or disaggregating on the use of managerial information. Although studies indicate that accounting information has the potential to support the decision-making process, they also point to its limited use. However, those studies have basically investigated aspects such as information received versus demanded, timeliness, and legal and corporate aspects. There remains the question of whether divergences in preferences regarding the way information is presented, between those who elaborate and those who use it, could also be an explanatory factor. Thus, this study sought to investigate, under the lens of Mental Accounting Theory (MAT), whether there are differences in operators' preferences that help to explain the low use of accounting information to support the decision-making process. The relevance of this article lies in better understanding the reasons for the low use of accounting information to support the decision-making process, despite its contributive potential, seeking organizational continuity and prosperity. As an impact on the area, this article helps preparers to understand and contemplate users' demands and preferences, resulting in greater use of information. The aim is for informed decisions to be taken without the influence of opportunisms, randomness, or the bias of whoever prepares the information. A quasi-experiment was operationalized with 1,074 students, 550 of accounting courses (preparers) and 524 of management courses (users) at four (public and private) universities in the south of Brazil. The study involves empirical, quantitative, descriptive, and applied research. For the data analysis, descriptive statistics, logistic regressions, and homogeneity analysis by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) were used. In most of the scenarios, the operators (preparers and users) presented a preference for disaggregating the information, independently of whether they follow the assumptions of MAT or not. It was observed that the search for informational volume for more assertive decision making predominates over the psychological gains and the value function perceived by the individual. Those who prefer disaggregated information are willing to align/use accounting information for management.},

No encontramos evidencia de impacto significativo del programa en la participación de las madres o de los niños en el mercado laboral.

We investigated the impact of a policy that financed the extension of school schedules from half to full days in Brazil on different maternal and child labor participation outcomes. To this end, we explored the discontinuity in the PME prioritization criteria implemented in 2012. In that year, the Ministry of Education started to favor schools with more than 50% of students as beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família Program (PBF). Our database consists of information on about 1 million families with children enrolled in the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th years in the public education system in the state of São Paulo in 2012. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that increasing the length of the daily school schedule had no impact on mothers’ or children’s labor decisions. To improve the robustness of our results, we also evaluated the program’s effects using a difference-in-differences approach. Again, we found no evidence of a significant effect of extending the school day on labor decisions. Our paper reinforces the need for a significant redesign of this policy.},

The international literature has noted the importance of school management and the principal’s profi le on students’ performance, but this discussion is recent in Brazil. In this study, we investigate the effects of the selection process of principals on students’ performance from public state schools in Brazil. We conclude that while the “selection process” channel is not clear, the “principal quality effect” indicates that the more democratic and technical selection methods tend to select most qualifi ed principals in terms of leadership and managerial abilities. The principal who has time to implement changes, who adopts management practices to encourage teachers and has experience being the leader of the school present better results in terms of student’s performance. Therefore, it is important that the principal selection process choose professionals with the skills mentioned.},

Citation counts have become a widely accepted measure of the quality of a scientific contribution. However, there are several problems involved in the use of citation counts as a measure of quality in science. First, citation counts are sensitive to popular trends in science. In this sense, they approximate a Nielsen rating for science. Second, the distribution of citations restricts their utility to separating the extremes. Third, citation counts are not sensitive to the ethical and moral dimensions of the quality of a scientific contribution. Fourth, citation counts underestimate the contribution of applied scientists.

   abstract = {This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a "meta-analysis" of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.},
